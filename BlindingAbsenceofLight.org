Title: The Blinding Absence of Light
Author: Tahar Ben Jelloun
Based on: True story (Tazmamart prison, Morocco)

Core Theme

Extreme physical confinement vs inner freedom

Survival through mental discipline, memory, and faith

Darkness as both punishment and philosophical space

Key Ideas

Absolute deprivation (light, food, time, human contact)

Prisoners survive not by hope of rescue, but by acceptance

The mind becomes:

A refuge

A storyteller

A spiritual anchor

Notable Insight

Suffering strips life to essentials → meaning is consciously constructed

Freedom ≠ external conditions

Silence and solitude can either destroy or awaken awareness

Personal Reflection (optional)

What practices today build inner freedom before crisis?

How much of suffering is physical vs psychological?
