#+TITLE: Household ROE — Bravo 1 (Emacs Org)

* Purpose
  Turn home chores and comms into tight, repeatable A–I–C brevity procedures. Ready for Emacs org workflows and quick capture.

* Quick Rules (one-line)

- Keep each transmission <= 6 words (verb–object–location).
- Use call-signs for non-visual targets.
- Sender remains until reply = {Complete|Negative}.
- URGENT prefixed for life/health.

* Templates
#+begin_src text
*A–I–C template (single line)*
- Action – Item – Context. Out.
- Example: "Resupply – H2O – Hall. Out."
#+end_src

** Radio exchange template

* Sender -> Receiver: <A–I–C>. Over.
* Receiver: <Response code>. Complete.
* Example:

  * Bravo 1 -> TOX: "Spin up – Washer – Laundry. Over."
  * TOX: "Wilco. Spin up begun. Complete."

- Standard Commands (brevity list)

* Resupply – H₂O – <loc>
* Deploy – Rations – <loc>
* Spin up – Washer – <loc>
* Kill – Lights – <loc>
* Seal – Door – <loc>
* Secure – Small unit – <loc>
* Waste detail – Execute – <loc>

- Response codes (short)

* Affirm — Acknowledged
* Negative — Cannot
* Wilco — Will comply
* Stand by — Hold
* Copy — Received
* Complete — Done

- Abbreviation glossary (for org capture)
  | Abbrev  | Expansion               |
  |---------+-------------------------|
  | H2O     | Water/resupply          |
  | AO      | Area of operations      |
  | Rations | Food                    |
  | SU      | Small unit (baby/child) |
  | Spin    | Start machine/cycle     |

- Examples — real exchanges (copy/paste)

* Bravo 1 -> Logistics: "Resupply – H2O – Kitchen. Out."

* Logistics: "Affirm. H2O enroute. Complete."

* Bravo 1 -> Watcher: "Secure – SU – Nursery. Out."

* Watcher: "Stand by. Assessing. Complete."

* Bravo 1 -> TOX: "Kill – Lights – Lounge. Over."

* TOX: "Wilco. Lights off. Complete."

- Silent / Ghost Protocols (sleep ops)

* Visual only: glance down = Acknowledge.
* Breath check = Assess.
* Finger flick = Recommit / Next.
* If multi-person: pre-agree 1-finger = pickup, 2-finger = urgent.

- Micro-AAR (org quick-capture)
  Use this org capture template to log micro-AARs fast.

** Capture template: *MICRO-AAR* %U

* Mission: %^{Mission name}
* Time: %U
* Outcome: %^{Affirm/Negative}
* Discipline: %^{1..5}
* Friction: %^{What slowed you?}
* Next: %^{Next op}

- Daily Command Net (org agenda)
  Schedule these entries in your org-agenda for automation.

** 07:00 -- Morning brief

* Task: Priorities set by Bravo 1.
* Template: "BRAVO1 -> ALL: <A–I–C list>. Out."

** 12:30 -- Midday logistics check

* Logistics reports status in a single line.

** 21:00 -- Night secure

* Watcher confirms "Secure – SU – Quarters. Complete."

- 60s Circuit Checklist (repeatable)

* [ ] Trash status
* [ ] Laundry tick
* [ ] Rations prepped
* [ ] Entry points sealed
* [ ] Lights adjusted

- Training drills (5-min runs)

1. 90-second spin-up: one person runs through 5 templates aloud.
2. Silent relay: use Ghost Protocol for three consecutive ops.
3. Rapid A–I–C: create 10 valid commands in 2 minutes.

* Conversion snippets (use in Emacs snippets / yasnippet)

- #+BEGIN_SRC snippet : key resupply
  Resupply – H2O – $1. Out.
- #+END_SRC

* Export targets

- To export as .org file: save buffer as household-roe.org.
- To export to PDF: C-c C-e l p (Org LaTeX export) or C-c C-e o p (HTML -> print).

* Notes on brevity discipline

- Aim for rhythm: strong verb first.
- Avoid adjectives. Kill extraneous words.
- If you must clarify, do it with one follow-up line only.

* Closing
  This org file is your living ROE. Tweak call-signs and roles to match household. Keep it under 1 screen for speed.
