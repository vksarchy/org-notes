#+title: Bhagavad_Geeta


Control what you do , you do not control happens afterwards
job is your action,

attachment triggers your thraet response

here where it gets interesting:
consistence - process / not outcome
detachment isn't a spiritual fluff

during flow , defeault mode network - thinking about yourself, your image

noise kills precision

detacmment quites that noise
redirect your carrying to process

pivot without panick - the detached one

Nishkama Karma
internsel present ,completely committed , 'highest form of discipline'

outcome is just data - data
detachment becomes just work -

* Process Goals
