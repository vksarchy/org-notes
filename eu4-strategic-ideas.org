* EU4 Idea Groups Master Note: Aristocratic vs Plutocratic

** Overview
These two idea groups represent fundamentally different power structures:

* *Aristocratic Ideas* → Feudal nobility, cavalry elites, monarchy expansion.
* *Plutocratic Ideas* → Merchant elites, trade wealth, republican stability.

They are not just military or economic bonuses — they shape how your nation develops.

** Advanced Veteran Tips

*** Tip 1 — Government Matters More Than Ideas
Republic → Plutocratic usually stronger.
Monarchy → Aristocratic usually stronger.

---

*** Tip 2 — Economy Wins Late Game Wars
Professional armies funded by trade outperform manpower blobs eventually.

---

*** Tip 3 — Goods Produced Is King
Late-game economy depends heavily on:

* Manufactories
* Trade steering
* Goods produced stacking.

Plutocratic excels here.

---

*** Tip 4 — Cavalry Timing Window
Aristocratic cavalry strongest:

* Early game
* Eastern tech groups
* Horde play.

Later infantry dominance reduces impact.

---

** Quick Decision Guide

Pick *Aristocratic* if:

* Monarchy
* Heavy conquest planned
* Cavalry nation
* Early military dominance needed.

Pick *Plutocratic* if:

* Republic
* Trade empire focus
* Tall development play
* Long-term economic scaling desired.

---

** One-Line Summary

Aristocratic = *Feudal military expansion power.*
Plutocratic = *Merchant economic stability power.*

Both are excellent — but optimal when matched with the right government and strategy.
