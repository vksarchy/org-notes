#+title: Eu4 Trade System Guide

* Trade System Overview

** What Is Trade in EU4?
Trade is the primary source of income for most nations. Ducats flow through a network of trade nodes, pushed by merchants and trade power. Your goal: collect as much trade value as possible in your home node.

** Core Concepts
*** Trade Node
- Geographic point where trade value accumulates
- All trade happens at nodes — control nodes = control income
- Affected by province trade power and merchants

*** Trade Value
- Total ducats available in a node (local production + incoming steered value)
- More value = more money to collect or steer
- Driven by goods produced and production development

*** Trade Power
- Your nation's influence at a node (your share of the pie)
- *Trade Power Share* = your TP ÷ total TP at a node (%)
- Higher share = more ducats collected or steered
- Sources: provinces, light ships, merchants, buildings, trade companies

*** Collecting vs. Steering
- *Collecting* :: Taking ducats out of a node into your treasury
- *Steering (Transferring)* :: Pushing trade value from one node downstream toward another
- Golden rule: *STEER everywhere, COLLECT only at home*

*** Home Node
- Your capital's trade node — you auto-collect here for free
- Best collection efficiency — always maximize your home node
- Can be changed by moving your trade port (costs 200 diplo points)

*** Merchants
- Agents assigned to nodes to collect or steer trade
- Without merchants, you have no active control of trade flow
- Sources: national ideas, trade ideas, colonies, trade companies

*** Trade Range
- How far your merchants can reach from owned provinces
- Increases with diplo tech, trade ideas, and colonial range

*** Trade Goods
- Each province produces a specific trade good with a market price
- High-value goods (cloth, spices, gold) generate more trade value
- Boosted by manufactories, trade companies, and production development

** Trade Node Mechanics

*** Node Types
- *Upstream Nodes* :: Nodes that feed value INTO a node (e.g., Ivory Coast feeds Sevilla)
- *Downstream Nodes* :: Nodes that receive value FROM a node (you steer downstream toward home)
- *End Nodes* :: Nodes with no outgoing connections — value can ONLY be collected here, never leaves
  - English Channel (richest)
  - Genoa (second richest)
  - Venice (third)
- *Inland Nodes* :: Continental nodes with no naval access — can't use light ships here

*** Node Value Formula
- Local value + incoming steered value − collected/steered out
- Optimize by maximizing inflow and minimizing others' collection

*** Multiple Outflows
- Most nodes can steer to 2–3 different downstream nodes
- Your merchants choose WHERE to push the value

*** Caravan Power
- Inland trade power based on total national development
- Large empires get automatic trade power bonus at inland nodes
- Benefits nations like Ming, Ottomans, Mughals

*** Critical Rule
- Trade flows *ONE DIRECTION ONLY* — you cannot push trade upstream
- Plan your expansion along trade flow direction

** Trade Power Sources

*** Provincial Trade Power
- Own provinces in a trade node — base source of TP
- Conquest is the most reliable way to gain trade power

*** Light Ships
- Each provides ~2–3 trade power (scales with naval tech)
- Most flexible and cost-effective TP source
- Assign fleets to "Protect Trade" in key nodes
- 20–50 ships is the sweet spot for most nations

*** Merchants
- +2 base trade power at assigned node
- Small but enables collection/steering actions

*** Trade Buildings
- *Marketplace* :: +50% provincial trade power (100 ducats)
- *Trade Depot* :: +100% provincial TP, replaces Marketplace (200 ducats, Tech 17)
- *Stock Exchange* :: +125% provincial TP, replaces Trade Depot (400 ducats, Tech 22)
- Build in highest-base-TP provinces first

*** Centers of Trade
- Provinces with CoT levels: Lv1 (+5 TP), Lv2 (+25 TP), Lv3 (+50 TP)
- Upgrading CoTs is one of the best TP investments per ducat
- Prioritize home node CoTs first

*** Trade Companies
- Assign provinces outside your home subcontinent to a TC
- +100% provincial trade power
- Free merchant at 51%+ TP in the trade company's node
- Crucial for colonial and trade empires

*** Estuaries & Straits
- Natural geographic modifiers on certain provinces (+10–25 TP)
- Cannot be created — must conquer provinces that have them

*** Transferring Merchant Bonus
- Each merchant in a steering chain adds +5% value to steered trade
- Chain of 3 merchants = +15% value bonus — compounds significantly

*** Ideas & Policies
- Trade Ideas, Plutocratic, Diplomatic give global TP bonuses
- Stack with buildings for enormous effect

*** Privateer Fleets
- Send fleets to privateer in rivals' trade nodes
- Steals their TP and gives you Power Projection
- 10–20 ships enough to be effective

*** Embargo Rivals
- Diplomatic action against rivals
- Steals trade power at shared nodes — completely free, always do it

** Collecting vs. Steering — Detailed Rules

*** Collect at Home Node
- Auto-collect with NO merchant needed
- Full trade efficiency, no penalty
- +10% bonus with merchant assigned (optional but good)

*** Collect at Non-Home Node
- Assign merchant to collect at a foreign node
- *-50% trade power penalty* for collecting outside home
- Only do this if you dominate a distant node and can't steer to home

*** Steer (Transfer)
- Assign merchant to push trade value downstream
- No penalty — adds steering bonus to value
- *This is your default action for all merchants outside home*

*** Steering Bonus
- Each merchant in a chain adds +5% value to steered trade
- Compounds: 3 merchants in chain = +15% value bonus
- Build the longest chain you can toward your home node

*** Multiple Collection Penalty
- If you collect in 2+ nodes (including home), penalty applies to non-home
- -50% TP in all non-home collection nodes
- Avoid unless you have massive isolated trade power

** Major Trade Routes & End Nodes

*** English Channel (END NODE)
- *Key Nations:* England, Netherlands, France
- Richest end node — all of Europe feeds here
- Strategy: dominate with provinces + light ships; collect here

*** Genoa (END NODE)
- *Key Nations:* Genoa, Spain, France, Aragon
- Second richest — Mediterranean + African trade
- Strategy: control Sevilla upstream, collect at Genoa

*** Venice (END NODE)
- *Key Nations:* Venice, Austria, Hungary
- Third end node — Eastern Mediterranean trade
- Strategy: good for Central European / Italian nations

*** Sevilla → Genoa/English Channel
- *Key Nations:* Castile, Portugal
- Gateway for New World colonial trade
- Strategy: steer colonial wealth to Genoa or English Channel

*** Malacca → India → Gulf of Aden
- *Key Nations:* SE Asian & Indian nations
- Spice trade route — enormous value
- Strategy: control straits, build trade companies

*** Beijing → Nippon/Malacca
- *Key Nations:* Ming, Japan, Manchu
- East Asian trade — huge production value
- Strategy: collect at Beijing/Nippon or steer south

*** Ivory Coast → Sevilla
- *Key Nations:* Portugal, Castile, Mali
- West African trade gateway
- Strategy: colonial nations auto-steer here toward Europe

*** Caribbean → Sevilla
- *Key Nations:* Colonial powers
- New World wealth pipeline
- Strategy: colonial nations steer toward Sevilla automatically

*** Lübeck
- *Key Nations:* Denmark, Hanseatic nations
- Baltic trade hub — excellent for Scandinavia/N. Germany
- Strategy: collect here as Denmark or Brandenburg

** Merchant Placement Strategy

*** Rule 1: Maximize Steering Chains
- Place merchants in a continuous chain toward home node
- Example: Bengal → Gujarat → Gulf of Aden → Alexandria → Genoa
- *Highest priority* — this is the core strategy

*** Rule 2: Steer High-Value Nodes
- Put merchants at the richest upstream nodes you can reach
- Malacca has huge spice value — always steer if you can reach it

*** Rule 3: Compete at Contested Nodes
- Place merchants where rivals have high TP to fight for share
- Only if you have meaningful TP there

*** Rule 4: Don't Waste on Tiny Nodes
- Skip nodes where your TP is <10% — minimal return
- Better to focus merchants where you can make a difference

*** Rule 5: Collect at Isolated Rich Nodes (Last Resort)
- Only collect outside home if you dominate and can't steer to home
- Example: Ming collecting at Beijing when value can't reach a better node

*** Rule 6: Colonial Auto-Steer
- Colonial nations automatically steer trade toward overlord
- Colonize for passive trade income — no merchant needed

** Trade Efficiency & Income Modifiers

*** Trade Efficiency
- Source: ideas, advisors, tech, traditions
- Multiplier on collected trade income
- +30% TE = 30% more ducats collected
- Stacks additively

*** Trade Steering
- Source: ideas, advisors, policies
- Increases value added when steering trade
- More steering = more value arrives at home node

*** Goods Produced Modifier
- Source: buildings (workshop, manufactory), ideas
- Increases trade value generated by each province
- *Multiplicative with base goods — extremely powerful*
- Single most impactful trade modifier in the game

*** Production Efficiency
- Source: ideas, tech, buildings
- Increases production income (NOT trade value)
- Common confusion: this boosts production income, not trade

*** Trade Good Price
- Source: global events, supply/demand
- Higher price = more value per unit produced
- Can't directly control — low supply goods are worth more

*** Mercantilism
- Source: events, decisions, DLC mechanics
- Increases provincial trade power, hurts foreign traders
- Higher mercantilism = less TP for foreign merchants in your nodes

* Trade Buildings & Infrastructure

** Building Priority Order
1. *Manufactory* (500 ducats) — +1 goods produced — BEST BUILDING IN THE GAME
2. *Workshop* (100 ducats) — +50% production income — fast ~10 year payback
3. *Marketplace* (100 ducats) — +50% provincial trade power — cheap and effective
4. *Center of Trade Upgrade* (200–1000 ducats) — +25/+50 TP per level — massive per ducat
5. *Trade Depot* (200 ducats, Tech 17) — +100% provincial TP — upgrade of Marketplace
6. *Counting House* (400 ducats) — +100% production income — late game upgrade
7. *Stock Exchange* (400 ducats, Tech 22) — +125% provincial TP — end-game

** Trade Companies (Dharma DLC)

*** What Are They?
- Assign provinces outside your home subcontinent to a trade company
- +100% provincial trade power
- No manpower from these provinces (trade-off)

*** Extra Merchant
- At 51%+ TP in a TC's trade node, you get a free merchant
- Merchants are scarce — this is huge
- Prioritize getting 51% in key TC nodes

*** Trade Company Investments
- Special buildings only for TC provinces
- Governors' Estate (+1 goods produced — build first)
- Brokers' Office, Officers' Mess, etc.
- Cost 400–1000 ducats each

*** Best TC Regions
- India, SE Asia, China coast, East Africa
- Enormous trade value in these nodes
- Colonize or conquer coastal provinces

*** TC vs. Full Core
- TC: better for trade (TP bonus) but no manpower
- Full core: gives both TP and manpower
- TC for trade nodes, full core in your heartland

** Light Ship Fleet Management

*** How Many to Build
- 20–50 light ships is the sweet spot for most nations
- Start with 20 early game, scale up as economy grows
- Each gives ~2–3 TP (scales with naval tech)

*** Where to Assign
- Home node FIRST — always your top priority
- Then upstream nodes where you have merchants and provinces
- Never assign ships to a node without a merchant or provinces

*** Trade Fleet Admiral
- Assign admiral to trade fleet for small TP bonus
- Maneuver pips increase trade power
- Low priority — nice to have, use old admirals

*** Privateer Fleets
- Send to rival's trade nodes to steal TP
- 10–20 ships enough to annoy rivals
- Gives Power Projection if privateering rival's nodes

** Muscovy 🇷🇺
- *Home Node:* Novgorod
- *Strategy:* Conquer Novgorod, collect there. Push east into Kazan for furs
- Fur provinces are very valuable; steer from Central Asia

** Denmark 🇩🇰
- *Home Node:* Lübeck
- *Strategy:* Dominate Baltic trade. Steer from North Sea and White Sea
- Control sound toll provinces; conquer Hanseatic cities

** Brandenburg 🇩🇪
- *Home Node:* Lübeck (move trade port here)
- *Strategy:* Conquer Lübeck province; build TP in Saxony and Lübeck
- Military focus first, trade comes naturally with conquest

** Poland 🇵🇱
- *Home Node:* Krakow
- *Strategy:* Inland node — weak for trade. Can steer from Kiev and Black Sea
- Don't prioritize trade — military and PU with Lithuania more important

* Mastery Roadmap

** Phase 1: Foundation (First 50 Years, Tech 1–7)

*** Focus Areas
- Identify your home node on the trade map (press 'E')
- Build 10–20 light ships, assign to protect trade in home node
- Assign merchants: one steers upstream, one optionally collects at home
- Build marketplaces in highest-TP provinces (Centers of Trade first)
- Read trade good prices — fur, cloth, spices are high-value
- Don't collect outside home — keep merchants on steer

*** Goal
Understand where your money comes from. Have a functioning trade fleet and at least 2 merchants assigned.

** Phase 2: Intermediate (Years 50–150, Tech 7–16)

*** Focus Areas
- Build merchant chains: continuous chain from upstream nodes to home
- Upgrade Centers of Trade (Lv2 → Lv3) — massive TP per ducat
- Start building manufactories in EVERY province (+1 goods produced each)
- Expand along trade routes — conquer provinces upstream of home node
- Set up trade companies for +100% TP and extra merchants
- Always embargo rivals — free trade power
- Take Trade Ideas as 2nd or 3rd idea group

*** Goal
Have 3–4 merchants in a chain. Trade income should be your #1 income source. Start building manufactories.

** Phase 3: Mastery (Years 150+, Tech 16+)

*** Focus Areas
- Dominate an end node (English Channel, Genoa, or Venice)
- Manufactory in every single province
- Optimize steering — ensure every merchant maximizes value flow
- Build trade company empire in India, SE Asia, China coast
- Stack modifiers: Trade Ideas + policies + advisors + buildings
- Control 3–4 major trade routes feeding your end node
- Move trade port if your home node is weak

*** Goal
Trade income > 50% of total income. Manufactory in every province. Dominate at least one end node completely.

** Answer Key

*** Fundamentals
1. A geographic point where trade accumulates. Value = local goods produced + incoming steered value.
2. Your influence at a node. Share = your TP ÷ total TP at node. Higher share = more ducats.
3. Collecting takes ducats out of a node. Steering pushes value downstream toward your home node.
4. Collecting outside home incurs -50% TP penalty. Steering adds a bonus to value and builds chains.
5. A node with no outgoing connections. English Channel, Genoa, Venice.
6. Each merchant in a steering chain adds +5% to steered value. 3 merchants = +15% bonus.
7. Your capital's trade node. You auto-collect here with no penalty and full efficiency.

*** Trade Power & Ships
8. Provinces, light ships, merchants, buildings (marketplace etc.), Centers of Trade, trade companies.
9. Each gives ~2–3 TP. Build 20–50 and assign to Protect Trade in your home/key nodes.
10. Special provinces with +5/+25/+50 TP at levels 1/2/3. Upgrading is one of the best TP investments.
11. +100% provincial TP. Free merchant at 51%+ TP in the trade company's node.
12. Steals trade power from them at shared nodes. Free to do, always worth it.

*** Strategy & Optimization
13. Manufactory. +1 goods produced per province. Massively increases trade value across entire empire.
14. Manufactory > Workshop > Marketplace > CoT upgrade. Manufactories have highest long-term ROI.
15. When you can dominate a richer node (especially an end node) than your current home node.
16. Place merchants in connected nodes, each steering downstream toward your home node in sequence.
17. Multiplier on base goods output. Directly increases trade value generated by every province.
18. Expand UPSTREAM of your home node. Conquer provinces in nodes that feed into your collection point.
19. End node (trade can't leave), receives trade from all of Europe, Americas, and Africa. Highest total value.
20. Trade Ideas (+50% global TP, +40% TE, +2 merchants), Plutocratic, Economic-Trade policy, advisor bonuses.
