### 🧠 **BRAIN MODE:**
Hannibal’s legacy as one of history’s greatest military tacticians is cemented by his innovative use of terrain, psychological warfare, and the integration of diverse forces. His crossing of the Alps remains one of antiquity’s most daring military feats, and his victories at Trebia, Trasimene, and Cannae are still studied for their tactical brilliance. Despite his eventual defeat, Hannibal’s campaigns profoundly shaped Roman military doctrine and the future of the Mediterranean world.
