#+title: Trickster Runs the World
#+date: [2025-06-19 Thu 21:52]
#+AUTHOR: Lewis Hyde
That line — **"The trickster commonly relies on his prey to help him spring the traps he makes"** — is a rich observation from *The Trickster Makes This World* by Lewis Hyde. It reveals a core dynamic in how the *trickster* figure operates across myths, folktales, and even modern life.

Let’s unpack it:

---

### 🔥 Core Concept:

The **trickster doesn’t act with brute force or domination**. Instead, he creates situations — traps, dilemmas, deceptions — **where the victim unknowingly completes the trick**. The trick works **because the prey contributes to their own downfall**, often through their **own greed, pride, ignorance, or rigid thinking**.

---

### 🧠 How the Trick Works:

* The trickster sets up the **frame** or **scenario**.
* The **target's own behavior** activates it.
* The result is often unexpected or paradoxical: **the prey “traps” themselves**.

---

### 🔍 Examples:

1. **Coyote in Native American tales** often fools others by manipulating their expectations. He might say “Don’t open this bag,” knowing the listener’s curiosity will do the job.
2. **Anansi the Spider (West African folklore)** tricks people into giving him power or goods — not by stealing, but by making them offer it.
3. **Loki (Norse mythology)** creates chaos not by pure destruction but by pulling strings and letting others take the bait.
4. **Modern version**: In a con game, the mark **wants** to believe they’re getting an easy win. The conman simply creates a setup that lets the mark fall into their own trap.

---

### 📖 What Hyde is saying:

Hyde’s book explores how tricksters are **boundary-crossers**, **culture-makers**, and **disruptors of order**. This particular quote is about **power without violence** — tricksters **don’t overpower**, they **outmaneuver**. They **study the psychology of others**, and turn their assumptions, habits, and even moral values **against them**.

---

### 🧩 Why It Matters:

Trickster stories challenge us to ask:

* What traps am I setting for myself?
* What systems do I blindly trust?
* Where am I predictable, and therefore vulnerable?

And for creators, leaders, rebels, and hackers — understanding the trickster’s craft means understanding **how transformation happens from within the system**.

---

Would you like examples from Indian myths too (like Krishna or Narada) that use this trickster principle?

##### MIND BLOWN @@@@@

Excellent. You’ve now landed at the **philosophical crux** of Hyde’s analysis of the trickster — not just as a clever thief, but as a **subversive commentator** on the systems of power, survival, and pride.

Let’s untangle this passage piece by piece:

---

### 🦈 **“Each of these tales has a predator-prey relationship in it…”**

These stories aren't just whimsical folklore — they model **core survival structures**:

* **Fish and fishermen** → classic **eater and eaten**.
* Nature, culture, economics — all built on **who gets what, and how**.

> This is what Hyde calls the “eating game” — a metaphor for any system built on dominance, hierarchy, and consumption.

---

### 🐍 **“The bait thief doesn’t enter directly into that oppositional eating game…”**

Here’s the trickster’s genius:

* He doesn’t play **the official game** (predator vs. prey).
* Instead, he finds a side door. **He feeds without fighting**.

> Think: not a lion chasing a gazelle, but a jackal snatching leftovers when no one’s looking.

He’s a **parasite** — or more precisely, what Hyde calls an **epizoon**:

> A creature that *lives off* others while **remaining outside their rules**.

---

### 🎭 **“From that position… he becomes a kind of critic of the usual rules…”**

This is the masterstroke:

* The trickster isn’t just misbehaving — he’s **commenting on the absurdity or rigidity of the system itself**.
* By stealing the bait, he reveals the **fragility of the system**: how much it depends on shared assumptions, routines, pride.

The trapper thinks he’s clever — but now **his trap doesn’t work**, and **he doesn’t know why**.

> It’s like someone turning off the Wi-Fi at a hackers’ conference.

---

### 🪞 **“What trapper’s pride could remain unshaken once he’s read Coyote’s commentary?”**

This rhetorical question hits hard:

* The **trapper’s ego** depends on believing his method is foolproof.
* The trickster **deflates that ego** — not with violence, but with **embarrassment**.

Imagine a magician getting his trick ruined by a kid in the audience pointing out the string. That’s Coyote’s commentary.

> The trickster doesn’t just win — he *mocks* the very premise of the game.

### 🧠 Summary:

| Role                          | Description                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Trapper (Fisherman)**       | Believes in his system — that it works, that it's fair, that it's clever.                        |
| **Trickster (Raven, Coyote)** | Bypasses the rules, *feeds anyway*, and in doing so **exposes the vulnerability of the system**. |
| **Outcome**                   | The system is not destroyed, but **revealed as limited, fallible, even laughable**.              |

Would you like a real-world or cultural example where this plays out — like a modern Raven in business, politics, or technology? Or would you prefer we stay in the mythic zone?


############################################################

You’re diving into one of the most nuanced layers of Lewis Hyde’s portrayal of the **trickster** — not just as a mischievous survivor, but as a **mythic force navigating a world full of devouring powers**.

Let’s break this down, idea by idea:

---

### 🔥 1. **More Than Just Survival: Don’t Get Eaten**

> *“Trickster must do more than feed his belly; he must do so without himself getting eaten.”*

This is **the core challenge of being a trickster**:

* He’s driven by hunger (literal and symbolic: food, sex, power, curiosity).
* But unlike the classic predator, **he can’t dominate with strength**.
* And unlike the prey, **he refuses to submit**.

So he has to **dance** between the two: eat **without being eaten**.

---

### 🧠 2. **Trickster’s Intelligence = Appetite + Subversion**

> *“His intelligence springs from appetite in two ways; it simultaneously seeks to satiate hunger and to subvert all hunger not its own.”*

This is *chef’s kiss* Hyde logic.

Trickster’s smarts don’t come from noble virtue or divine inspiration.
They come from **hunger** — but not just any hunger:

* He wants to feed **himself**, yes.
* But he also wants to **disrupt or dodge** all other forces of hunger — meaning any system, creature, or rule that tries to eat **him** or **others**.

> He doesn’t just want food. He wants **freedom from being food**.

---

### 🐺 3. **Coyote as Monster-Slayer**

> *In the Okanagon story, the Great Spirit sends Coyote to kill monsters who devour humans, and to teach people how to live.*

This sets up **trickster as both destroyer and teacher**.

Coyote isn’t a cuddly helper — he’s the one **clever enough** and **unscrupulous enough** to kill ancient predators (the “devouring forces”).

The monsters represent:

* **Brutal survival structures**
* **Exploitative systems**
* **Things that consume without conscience**

So trickster becomes the **liberator**, not through heroism, but through **cunning and refusal to play fair**.

---

### 🎯 4. **The Mythic Meaning: Outsmarting the Eaters**

> *“There are large, devouring forces in this world, and trickster’s intelligence arose not just to feed himself but to outwit these other eaters.”*

Hyde isn’t just talking about literal monsters or animals.

He’s pointing at **capitalism, empires, hierarchies, oppression** — systems that “eat” people, time, souls.

The trickster:

* Can’t beat these forces head-on.
* But he can **slip through the cracks**, **expose absurdities**, **steal a bite**, **disrupt the game**.

---

### 🕊️ 5. **Two Strategies: Outwit vs. Opt Out**

> *“Typically, this meeting is oppositional… The bait thief suggests a non-oppositional strategy.”*

This is crucial.

* **Oppositional strategy** = prey beats predator (e.g., Coyote kills a monster).
* **Non-oppositional** = Raven steals bait while everyone’s distracted — no fight, just finesse.

So sometimes the trickster **fights monsters**, but sometimes he just **shrugs off the system**, slipping by with a smirk.

> He’s not trying to win the game — he’s trying to **rewrite** or **exit** it.

---

### 🧘 6. **A Desire to Escape the Game Entirely**

> *“Another force behind trickster’s cunning is the desire to remove himself from the eating game altogether.”*

Now we get to the **deep philosophical kicker**.

What if the trickster is trying to **transcend** the entire eat-or-be-eaten cycle?

Not by dying or starving.
Not by dominating.

But by finding the **cleverest way to keep eating… while staying just outside the food chain**.

> He becomes a **witness**, a **commentator**, a **comic saboteur**. Never fully in the system, never fully out.

---

| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Trickster must eat but not be eaten**       | He survives through intelligence, not strength.                                   |
| **His intelligence is appetite + subversion** | He feeds himself while undermining forces that want to feed on him.               |
| **Kills devouring monsters**                  | In myth, he destroys forces that prey on humans.                                  |
| **Two tactics: opposition or sidestep**       | He either outsmarts predators or avoids the game entirely (like the bait thief).  |
| **Wants to escape the system**                | At his core, he’s trying to *stay alive* without ever being trapped by the rules. |

Would you like this applied to a real-world example — maybe in business, media, or politics — to see how this plays out today?

#####################
* Arhcetype building

You're stepping into one of the oldest, sharpest, and most subversive worldviews humanity has produced — that of the **trickster**. Not a villain, not a hero, but a **shape-shifting force** who survives and thrives by dancing at the edge of systems, rules, and identities.

If you're rebuilding your life around this archetype, then you’ll want **daily reminders, internal questions, and example moves** that help you stay *clever, subversive, and free* — all while still feeding your belly and not getting eaten.

Let’s forge this belief system in three layers:

---

## ⚡ I. Trickster's Creed (Your Internal Operating Code)

Repeat these to yourself. They're not dogma — they’re *disruption logic*:

1. **I am not in the game to win. I am in it to see through it.**
2. **I feed myself, but I refuse to feed monsters.**
3. **I don’t challenge walls head-on. I find the cracks.**
4. **I obey just long enough to learn how to break the rule.**
5. **My appetite is my compass. My cunning is my shield.**
6. **When others speak in certainty, I smirk in curiosity.**
7. **I wear masks, but I am never the mask.**
8. **I am the one who leaves the backdoor open.**

## 🔍 II. Daily Trickster Questions (To Keep You Sharp)

Ask these like mantras — not to find fixed answers, but to loosen grip:

| Theme        | Questions                                                                                                           |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Power**    | Who’s trying to eat me today? Where do I *feed* without being fed on?                                               |
| **System**   | What rule am I following that no longer makes sense? Where can I *play with* the structure instead of submit to it? |
| **Identity** | Am I wearing a mask — and if so, do *I* control it?                                                                 |
| **Conflict** | Is this a fight worth winning? Or is it a game better escaped?                                                      |
| **Survival** | What’s my appetite today? And how can I feed it without selling my soul?                                            |
| **Humour**   | What would make this situation absurd? What’s funny here that no one else sees?                                     |
| **Legacy**   | Am I killing monsters — or accidentally becoming one?                                                               |
| **Position** | Am I stuck in the middle of the eating game — or am I hovering just outside it?                                     |
