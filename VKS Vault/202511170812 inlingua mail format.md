📧 Subject: Proposal for Foreign Language Training Collaboration with inlingua

Dear [Dr./Mr./Ms.] [Name],

Greetings from inlingua.

I am reaching out to propose a collaboration between inlingua and [College Name] to introduce a structured foreign language training program for your students, with the objective of enhancing their global employability and intercultural communication skills.

As your institution continues to produce technically strong graduates, we believe that equipping them with foreign language proficiency — such as German, Japanese, or French — will create a significant competitive advantage during campus placements, higher studies, and international opportunities.

Our program is designed to integrate seamlessly with academic and placement schedules, offering:

Language modules aligned with industry requirements (A1 to B2 levels).

Customisable delivery models (on-campus / hybrid / online).

Corporate-placement alignment through technical vocabulary and professional communication focus.

Certification from inlingua International, globally recognised across 30+ countries.

We would be pleased to present a brief proposal and implementation plan at your convenience — either through an in-person visit or a virtual meeting.

Kindly let us know a suitable time to connect with your academic or placement leadership team to discuss this initiative in detail.

Thank you for your time and consideration. We look forward to the opportunity to support your institution in enhancing its students’ global readiness.

Warm regards,
