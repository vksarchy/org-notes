**Inversion** and **via negativa** are related but not the same. Both involve thinking from a negative or subtractive perspective, but their purposes and applications differ. Here's a breakdown:

---

### **1. Inversion**

- **Definition**: A problem-solving or thinking technique that involves flipping a problem or situation on its head to explore its opposite or avoid undesirable outcomes.
- **Purpose**: To prevent mistakes, anticipate risks, or think creatively by considering what could go wrong or what is the opposite of success.
- **Application**:
    - Used in decision-making, strategy, and innovation.
    - Common in fields like business, investing, and engineering.
- **Example**:
    - Goal: "How can we make customers happy?"
        - Inversion: "What would make customers unhappy?"
            - Answer: Poor service, long wait times, or low-quality products.
            - Use this insight to ensure these issues are avoided.

### **2. Via Negativa**

- **Definition**: A way of understanding something by describing what it is _not_, rather than what it _is_.
- **Purpose**: To approach concepts that are difficult to define or articulate directly, often because they are abstract, complex, or ineffable.
- **Application**:
    - Often used in philosophy, theology, and mysticism.
    - Focused on describing abstract entities like God, freedom, or silence.
- **Example**:
    - Defining God: "God is not finite, not bound by time, and not comprehensible by human reason."

### **Key Differences**

|**Aspect**|**Inversion**|**Via Negativa**|
|---|---|---|
|**Purpose**|To solve problems by flipping perspectives.|To describe what something is by negation.|
|**Focus**|Opposite outcomes or failures.|What something is _not_.|
|**Application Area**|Practical (business, strategy, design).|Abstract (philosophy, theology, mysticism).|
|**Example Question**|"How do I fail?"|"What is God not?"|

### **Overlap**

Both involve negation or subtraction to gain understanding, but **inversion** is more action-oriented and applied, while **via negativa** is about understanding abstract concepts.
