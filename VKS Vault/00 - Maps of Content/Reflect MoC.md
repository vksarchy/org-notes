[[Interesting Man]] - Curiosity is the trait. 
Having a clear goal is the no 1 factor for getting into flow state 
Having a purpose 
Complete control of ourself 
even the GODS should feel jealous of us
We were given the free will to choose and become whatever we wanted to become. 
Write , Question, be curious. 
Dynamic Speaker 
What you see here n speak it out, you become verbal, the law of attraction is set in play. You have to see it and become vocal.
Perrio Technique to become the best learner. Man of knowledge. 
Control and become Relentless 

Doing things from the Heart
