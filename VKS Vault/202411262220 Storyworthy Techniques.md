#storyworthy 

The book _Storyworthy_ by Matthew Dicks offers transformative insights for creating and sharing compelling personal stories. Here are a few key techniques from the book that align with your curiosity, adaptability, and interest in teaching and storytelling:

---

### **Homework for Life**

This is the most powerful tip from _Storyworthy_:

1. **Daily Reflection**: Spend 5 minutes every evening asking yourself, _"What is the most storyworthy moment of my day?"_
2. Write it down in a single sentence or short paragraph. It doesn’t need to be earth-shattering; even the smallest moments often carry the deepest resonance.

**Why it suits you**: As someone adaptable and curious, this will help you see profound stories in everyday life, enhancing your understanding of what makes a moment meaningful.

---

### **Five-Second Moments**

Dicks argues that the most compelling stories often revolve around "five-second moments"—the brief, life-altering realizations or emotional shifts.

- Identify the **before** and **after** in a pivotal moment.
- Highlight the transformation clearly.

**For You**: Use this concept when designing lessons or inspiring others, as you could build narratives that evoke “aha!” moments, especially in areas like sustainability or consumer behavior.

---

### **The Stakes**

Stories without stakes lack tension.

- Ask: _"What did I stand to gain or lose in this moment?"_
- When stakes are clear, the audience engages emotionally.

**In Teaching**: When sharing concepts like GMROI or market analysis, frame them with stakes—how decisions impact revenue, livelihoods, or social responsibility.

### **The Framework**

1. **Hook**: Start with an engaging sentence to pull the listener in.
2. **The Event**: Share the core action or moment.
3. **The Realization**: End with the emotional, insightful takeaway.

**Why it resonates**: It mirrors your ability to simplify complex topics like predictive analytics or order fulfillment into digestible and impactful narratives.

---

### **Use Strategic Vulnerability**

Dicks emphasizes the power of authenticity. Share your failures, doubts, or personal growth moments. They connect you with others.  
**For Your Classes/Workshops**: Relate your bold and wise personality by sharing times when you adapted to challenges, fostering trust and relatability.
