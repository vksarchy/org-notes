Ho'Oponopo Meditation 

Goal - To take care of the inner child 
Practicing this for 3 sessions in the morning, evng & at night 
20 mins session 

Learnt that all the thoughts and actions will have an imprint on the subconscious child, Never take it for granted. 
Acknowledge that child and heal him of the pain and sufferings u have caused from being ignorant 

100% responsibility for your experience. 
Eg - the grandma who prayed to cure her grandson from cancer 

she prayed the wrong way, she prayed for the wrong person
it is her memory she has to heal, her experience she has to clear it. 

taking up that 100% responsibility of yourself and the possibility to change it - is what made me to take up this Ho'Opnopo seriously.
