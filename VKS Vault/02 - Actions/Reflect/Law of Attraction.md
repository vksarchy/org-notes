To get Enthusiastic and not excited. 
The only purpose of the mind is to create what we want. 
You are not the mind, you are not the body - you are AWARENESS
Ask yourself the question - Am I aware?
Then Stay as Awareness
Its like the mind is in front and awareness is in the back and as we ask this question we bring the awareness forward... 
You have to be in Love - Intellectually, Emotionally & Physically with the things we do, or with the business we are into.

You can Love anything and by that way you can be in harmony. 
To Start with after listening to this, bob recommends the following.. 

### Ask yourself what do you really want in this life?
### To start with ask yourself, what do you really love doing?
### Embrace the Negative Emotions. 
The more you welcome a negative emotion, the weaker they become.
