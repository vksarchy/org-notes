I dreamed of a mortal man, but now I am awake and I know that I am a child of God, made in the image of the father. 

I will change my consciousness until i get rid of the darkness and see HIS presence in me! 

Keep yourself busy with creative thinking and you shall see the moodiness will not disturb you as the Idle mind is the devil's workshop, keep yourself in HIS consciousness and your mind with creative thinking.
