What a fall... Dammm
Experience this fall completely, fully. 
My feelings 'shattered'
Is it even worth continuing. 
The questions coming up in my mind/// 
Fuck it. 
YES WE CAN & will keep going. 
Increase your faith & will power. 
Never give up. Time to be more stronger.
We are GOD's children. He will BLESS & GUIDE us. 
Time to increase the will power & faith on him.
