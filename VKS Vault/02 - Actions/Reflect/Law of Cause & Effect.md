What, Why & Who
Who do you want to become to achieve it

Inner Belief changes the outer belief 

The quality of your life determines the quality of the questions you ask 

Reticular Activating System 
 - It is incredibly biased 
 - Filters anything that - shows everything that need me to be 20L a month guy

When you are ready the things show up. 
Become that 10L guy inside & wait

If something happens & we give up, we begin to focus on the active resistance rather than the intention. 

WE HAVE TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE INNER & OUTER ACTION - 24x7

2 Different types of INTENTION 
Inner Action & Outer Action 

Inner Action - to do something (DO)

Outer Action - HAVING (Resolve to have)

Devoid of resistance , pure intention

### The Law of Cause & Effect Cheat Sheet 

1. How cause & effect works
1. Unseen source → There is an unseen source from which all reality is created.
2. Non-linear chain → On the surface, it may appear that A→B→C, but all A, B & C are originating from the unseen source.
    

2. What is the unseen source?  
1. Thoughts – The thoughts we think
2. Outer beliefs – The beliefs we have about the world
3. Inner beliefs (identity) – The beliefs we have about ourselves in relationship to our world.
    
4. Key – Focus on finding the unseen source from which everything originates. In the case of our own personal realities, it is the identity that causes the outer beliefs we have, the thoughts we think & the actions we take.

6. How to be at the cause
1. Inquire – Who must I become in order to effortlessly experience my goal as a normal reality? Eg. Quazi & becoming the $20k/m version.
2. Steps
1. Clarity - Get clear first on what is wanted (eg. $20k/m) then on who you must become.

2. Suspension of disbelief - what are key habits this ideal self follows without fail?  

3. Style of character - how does this ideal self dress?
    

3. Inner & outer action
1. Inner action – Intention. Influences future frames of reality.
1. Inner intention – my resolve to “do” in order to have

2. Outer intention – my resolve to “have” no matter what

2. Outer action – Physical action taken to influence current frame of reality

Key – Unite both. Take consistent inner and outer action for the fastest manifestation.**

Somewhere the law of cause and effect resonates a lot with me. #reflect 
All are effects are a part of our causes. 

>[!note] This law sheds light on the importance of prevention rather than remediation, encouraging us to focus on the causes of the problems rather than the effect. 

For this law to fully take us we need 'Vigilance, Self Awareness & Discipline' 
Vigilance - Requires constant awareness of our actions, thoughts & emotions 
Discipline - Discipline helps us in taking intentional causes rather than giving in to impulses that lead to harmful effects.
