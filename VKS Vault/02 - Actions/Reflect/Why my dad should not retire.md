I think my dad is slipping into mild depression.  
A man of routine should recogonize this early & cut this off at an early stage, else he will be trapped in a downward spiral. 
[[Best thing to get out of depression is to WIN.]] He needs a win.
### How can I help him? 
* Text/Speak to him about this issue 
* Make him to start dealing small cars
* Support him both mentally & financially 
* Next time you are here with him, engage him mentally by playing cards with him.
* Heal him through HO'Oponopo meditation
* Make him do things - assign tasks & follow up
* He is a good servant without a master. 
* Talk to Nathiya about this & make her believe about him.
