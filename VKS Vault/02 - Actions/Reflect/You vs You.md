 The real life example i had was one w/ AMG. The day we went out for drinks and came back home and i had a bitter experience using Arun's shoes. But the moment i told him about using this and how bitter he was, he didn't even listen to it.. That was a weird moment for me and then i realised it was a u v u situation where he was so focussed and concentrated on doing what was necessary to him and not interested in other's prob.
