Mind is a complex machine. You are a karma yogi. 
Wherever your desire is, your mind goes there. 
Yoga helps your mind to not get distorted. 
Your mind should act like a mirror, show yourself completely. 

Learn to keep your mind like a mirror. It simply shows what is there. It doesn't distort. 
Yoga helps you in this .
The moment you get identified with many things, it is distorted.

INENSITY WITHOUT INTENT 

LOA is the dumbest thing 

raise your intensity, so when life unfolds you do what is necessary at that time. 
If you set a goal, you only do something that you already know.
