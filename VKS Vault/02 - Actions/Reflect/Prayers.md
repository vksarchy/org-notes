Short Prayers:
Some examples of short prayers include:

- "Lord, have mercy on me." ([The Jesus Prayer](https://www.crosswalk.com/faith/prayer/what-is-the-jesus-prayer-and-why-do-people-pray-it.html))  
- "Lord, thank you for this beautiful day."  
- "May peace and love fill my heart."  
- "Show me the way to light and truth."  
- "Help me to be kind and patient."  
- "Guide me with your wisdom."

If you’re ready to pray a prayer that only God can answer, say this: _Lord, I am praying for what only You can do. I am praying for a miracle. I know the source from which it will come. I trust in You to send me a sign. Teach me dear Lord to know wonder. And, if You are willing, I am waiting, ready to receive my blessing today. Amen._

Let there be light and let the LIGHT fill me out
