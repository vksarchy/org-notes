Explanation: 
 If you want to understand the secrets of the universe; think interms of Energy, Frequency & Vibration  - Nikola #Tesla  

Everything is energy and that's all there is to it. Match the frequency of the reality you want and you cannot help but get that reality. It can be no other way. This is not Philosophy, but Physics - #Einsten

### Techniques to raise our vibration:
1. Visualization 
2. Affirmations
3. Meditation 
4. Gratitude

	When you inhabit the body, it will lift yourself onto a higher frequency. We just use our imagination and build the picture of the good we want. We then hold that picture using our will. The will is what gives us the idea to focus. 

### Examples of the desires and the corresponding vibrations we need to match:

Health & Wellness - Vitality, Energy and Well Being - Exercise, Meditation & Positive Self Talk 
Love & Relationships - Love, Joy & Connection - Gratitude, Self Care & Spending Time w Loved Ones 
Career Success - Confidence, Abundance & Growth - Positive Affirmations, Networking w Successful Ppl & Taking Steps Towards achieving our Goals. 
Creative Expression - Inspiration, Passion & Freedom - Practicing Creative Activities regularly setting aside time for creative expression & surrounding ourselves w Like Minded Induviduals. 
More Wealth - Abundance & Prosperity -  

As we begin to experience the LOV, we start to see that we are more than a singular being working our way through our human lives. Our very being CONSTANTLY moves, interacts and affects all things around us. This awareness leads us to live a more conscious and intentional life.  
At the core, the LOV teaches us to lead a meaningful and purposeful existence, one that is aligned with our deepest desires and aspirations.
