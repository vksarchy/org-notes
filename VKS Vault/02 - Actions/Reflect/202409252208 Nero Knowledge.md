Same energy but difference is the rate of vibration

Fear - Courage

Worry - Peace

Scarcity - Abundanec

Rate - Certainty

Shame - Proudness

Change your rate of vibrations.

How?

You alter your vibration through your alteration of your concentration.

Vibration, concentration

You are unaware of what you're concentrating,

You need to focus on things, that are aspects of life that you're abundanct in, peaceful in,

Centralize and focus on that

Feel more on that,

How to Outsmart your old self?

The universe is mental

Thought forms - Collection of thoughts + Emotions (Largest shareholder of your frequency)

![[Pasted image 20240925220910.png]]

Thought forms, form an entity - your old self

There are spiritual entities, like dopplegangers , if you're consistently thinking about and conecentrating on who you want to become, then it will manifest

There is a doppleganger that is built up from the frequencies that you’ve lived upon over these years, that frequency has given birth to an entity that continues to exist at any cost & it will do so.

1. Attention - old self will need your attention - seen your attention as an investment,

- You need to take the ROI of Your DR - Desired Reality - never give into your frustrations ,these are your distractions.

2. Sadistic - Your old frequency thrives on your negativity.

- It creates circumstances to enhance negativity. The old self is dangerous. That entity is nothing but a bunch of collective frequency.
- It is a frequency of your past years.
- It will try to get an emotino out of you. Your emotions are like a glue. You wlill be marked, and boom back to your old frequency.
- Until you can recrete yourself, you cannot recreate your reality.
- You have to alter the cause to alter the effect and the cause is always within.

3. Reactive

-  Most of us live us by eyesight, when we should be living by mindsight.
![[Pasted image 20240925221041.png]]
- It throws a few adversity and immediately we reactive - push our buttons, gets an emotion out of us -> emotions are glues
- Non - Reactive = beyond illusion, living in a reality by mindsight and not by eyesight.

- Why should reality submit to you when you cannot submit to yourself
- Why should reality allow you to control it
- Why should reality listen to you when you cannot listen to yourself
- When you're reacting left and right, you're higher level order of thinking is shut down.

4. Scared

- You want to leave it

![[Pasted image 20240925221505.png]]


- You're not living if you can't control, it's not control if you can't rearrange the boxes you want to and experience it.
- It plays a TRICK on you - it projects its fear onto you so u get scared of moving forward.
- That fear gets MAGNIFIED & MAINTAINED preventing you from moving forward.
- If you know yourself and the enemy, you don't need to fear the results of a 100 battles.

You can only have what you already have... 

Feeling a way you don’t want to feel right now is the FREQUENCY 
and ironically that’s gonna be the same frequency if you enter that now, that’s gonna lead to your DESIRE REALITY. 
Thinking of your destination is you’re starting location.
