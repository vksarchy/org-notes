Good morning ppl! 
What a day and how many realisations...
Jai Guru! 
Shri Paramahamsa Yogaananda. 
Shri Vaaraahi Amman Thunai! 

Many many realisations! 
Just to understand that the most important thing is to choose the right heroes. 
Yes I am stressing the word.. RIGHT. 

	Remebering my Guru's Words "Find HIM in the Silence and he will reveal the answers"

It is important to centre GOD in all your thoughts and activities.
