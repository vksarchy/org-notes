In shadows deep, where sorrows lie,
A tale of suffering, no need to deny.
The weight you bear, a heavy load,
Yet in its grasp, strength bestowed.

Through trials endured, a path untrod,
Each challenge faced, a sculpting rod.
In pain's embrace, resilience sown,
A spirit tested, but not overthrown.

Grit your teeth, face the strife,
Forge your mettle in the furnace of life.
The gym awaits, a sanctuary true,
Where sweat and toil renew.

Rise from anguish, a phoenix bold,
Muscles weary, but hearts unfold.
Transform the ache, let it propel,
A saga of triumph, where shadows quell.

So, read the tale of suffering's art,
Let it kindle flames within your heart.
Then to the gym, with purpose and might,
Shape your destiny, embrace the fight.

Suffering is not a flaw But a gift you can embrace It teaches you valuable lessons And helps you grow and improve

Suffering is not a burden But a fuel you can ignite You can either let it weigh you down Or use it to lift you up

Suffering is not a problem But a solution you can find You can either let it stop you Or use it to move you forward

Suffering is not a weakness But a strength you can unleash You can either let it defeat you Or use it to beat you
