The **Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio** is a financial metric that compares an individual's monthly debt payments to their monthly gross income. Here are the key points about DTI ratios:

### What is DTI Ratio?
- **Definition**: The DTI ratio is the percentage of your monthly gross income that goes towards paying your monthly debt payments[1][5][7].
- **Purpose**: It is used by lenders to assess a borrower's ability to manage their debt obligations and determine their borrowing risk[1][5][7].

### How to Calculate DTI
1. **Add Up Monthly Debt Payments**: Include all recurring monthly debt obligations such as mortgage or rent, car loans, credit card payments, student loans, and other debts. Exclude expenses like utilities, groceries, and insurance premiums[5][7].
2. **Determine Gross Monthly Income**: This is your pre-tax monthly income from all sources[5][7].
3. **Apply the Formula**:
   $$
   \text{DTI Ratio} = \left( \frac{\text{Total Monthly Debt Payments}}{\text{Gross Monthly Income}} \right) \times 100
   $$
   This gives you the percentage of your income that goes towards debt payments[2][5][7].

### Interpretation of DTI
- **Low DTI (Less Than 20%)**: Indicates a healthy financial balance with most of your income available for savings and discretionary spending[5].
- **Moderate DTI (20-36%)**: Suggests a manageable level of debt, typically considered acceptable by lenders[5].
- **High DTI (Above 36%)**: May raise concerns for lenders, indicating that you might be overextended with debt[1][5][7].

### Importance of DTI
- **Lending Decisions**: Lenders use DTI to determine whether you are a creditworthy borrower. A high DTI may indicate too much debt relative to your income, making you a riskier borrower[1][5][7].
- **Financial Stability**: A low DTI suggests a healthy balance between your income and debt, contributing to financial stability[5].
- **Creditworthiness**: A lower DTI ratio improves your chances of getting fast loan approval and sanctioning[6].

### General Guidelines
- **Preferred DTI**: Lenders generally prefer a DTI ratio of no more than 36%, with some allowing up to 43% for mortgage applications[1][3][7].
- **Impact on Credit Score**: While DTI itself does not directly affect your credit score, factors contributing to your DTI (like high credit card balances) can impact your credit score[3][7].

Understanding and managing your DTI ratio is crucial for maintaining good financial health and improving your chances of securing loans in the future.
