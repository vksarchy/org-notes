Capex, or **Capital Expenditure**, refers to the funds used by a company to acquire, upgrade, and maintain physical assets such as property, industrial buildings, or equipment. This type of expenditure is often used to undertake new projects or investments by the firm. Capex is essential for the growth and operational capacity of a business, as it focuses on long-term investments that improve the company's infrastructure and potential revenue.

Examples of Capex include:

- Buying new machinery or equipment
- Building new facilities or upgrading existing ones
- Purchasing land or vehicles
- Developing technology systems (software or hardware)

Capex is different from Opex (Operational Expenditure), which involves day-to-day operational costs. Capex is often reflected on the company's [[Balance Sheet]] while Opex appears on the [[Income Statement]]
