As I was watching Under the Queen's Umbrella I realised that Drama genre had all the right learnings for us. 
Concealed Beams 
Turn the tide for us. Don't control or choose. Try to turn the things/choices/ life happening in our favour and in our accordance. 
Need complete understanding of life itself. 
Only then we can master the flow of life and turn it to our favour. 

Our [[KARMA]] is in our hands
