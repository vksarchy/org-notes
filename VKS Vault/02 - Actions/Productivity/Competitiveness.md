A poem about competitiveness by Bing AI: 

```markdown
# Competitiveness

Some people think it's only about winning
But I believe there's more to that
It's about striving for excellence and never giving in
It's about overcoming obstacles and bouncing back

Some people think it's only about being the best
But I believe there's more to that
It's about learning from others and enhancing your skills
It's about following your passion and mastering your craft

Some people think it's only about beating the rest
But I believe there's more to that
It's about collaborating with others and creating value
It's about making an impact and contributing to the world

Competitiveness is not just a goal or an outcome
It's a mindset and a way of life
It's a journey of growth and a source of delight
It's a challenge to yourself and a reason to thrive
```
