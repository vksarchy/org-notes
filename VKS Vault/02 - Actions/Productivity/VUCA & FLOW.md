Challenge Skill level 
VUCA
volatility uncertainty complexity Ambiguity 

Intention on goals and direct action towards it
Later on shift the intention to life & all action towards it. 

VUCA is unavoidable 
Whether it overwhelms you or  propels you. 
When your arousal is managed, 
Volatility drives focus 
Uncertainty sharpens instincts  
Complexity engages abilities
Ambiguity awakens creativity 

vuca becomes flow fuel

Flow has 4 stages 
* Struggle 
When you see a hill - 'Sprint'  
* Release
* Flow  
* Recovery
