### Polarity Strategy 
1. Superficially Polite that could be seen as a cool move or as a subtle insult
2. Suddenly going full on mode, blasting him and offending him. Making them emotional and taking side.
3. Hernan Cortes - Go along, or seem to turn a blind eye: your enemies will soon go further, showing more of their hand. Now you have them in sight, and you can attack.
4. How do u pinpoint an enemy in an organisation - take a key member of the inner circle and tackle him, at one point the others will come to support him and take them all out. never aim at a vague, abstract enemy. It is hard to drum up the emotions to fight such a bloodless battle, which in any case leaves your enemy invisible. Personalize the fight, eyeball to eyeball.

> [!NOTE]
> Avoidance of conflict becomes a habit, and you'll lose the taste of battle.
> Conflict is Therapeutic
> Your enemies force on you a sense of realism & humility.

The search for enemies under control. We want CLARITY not PARANOIA. 
Polarizing game. 
Eg: Margaret Thatcher, usually brilliant at the polarizing game, eventually lost control of it: she created too many enemies and kept repeating the same tactic, even in situations that called for retreat. Franklin Delano Roosevelt was a master polarizer, always looking to draw a line between himself and his enemies. Once he had made that line clear enough, though, he backed off, which made him look like a conciliator, a man of peace who occasionally went to war. Even if that impression was false, it was the height of
wisdom to create it.



The English saw themselves as upholding traditions of the political freedom and civilized behavior. 

the strength that faced tranquilly
desertion at a moment of great need; the pride that would not utter a word of
appeal or reproach; the mild tolerance of one who knew men and counted
upon nothing from them

Better to disguise your maneuvers for power: you
do not want it but have found it forced upon you. Being passive and making
others come to you is a brilliant form of aggression

Passive Aggressive 

- The One-Upmanship Strategy
Art of One-Upmanship. 
It's a conventional warfare.
Defensive and Inferior, coverup & humiliate, in the end they have themselves to blame; 

one is up and the other is down
