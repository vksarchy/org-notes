Today i had a thought about thi following fleeting thought :

* The confidence booster 
 *  do one thing confidently and keep upgrading it one by one 
 * master one thing and upgrade the rest
* what causes stress?
  * The stress reacts to in a way that if two opposing views are in par with ourselves we are prone to stress  
  * 2 opposing views - causes stress 
  * stick with one and see stress go down 
  So we can see where these ideas are being used and collaborated 
* 

### Up 

### Down
Confidence and how the mind reacts in this state
