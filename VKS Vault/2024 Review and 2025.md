Here is a summary of the video, along with some relevant questions to help you remember the content:

In the video, Vicky Zhao, the speaker, emphasizes the importance of not just planning for the next year, 2025, but also ensuring that those plans are acted upon. She points out that many people are good at creating plans but struggle with implementing them. To solve this, she suggests a 15-minute exercise divided into three 5-minute segments: review, plan, and prioritize.

**Review**

- The review process starts with identifying the 20% of actions that yielded 80% of the results in the current year. This involves recognizing tasks or collaborations that were most fruitful and those that were time-wasting.
- The speaker highlights the importance of saying "no" to commitments that do not contribute significantly to one's goals and avoiding last-minute planning.
- She also emphasizes the need to identify and eliminate actions that led to only 20% of the results despite taking up 80% of the time.

**Plan**

- In the planning phase, Vicky recommends using a mind map to brainstorm goals for different time frames: 3 months, 1 year, 3 years, and a lifetime.
- This helps in visualizing long-term goals and breaking them down into smaller, achievable steps.

**Prioritize**

- The prioritization phase involves selecting one key goal for each time frame and then narrowing it down to a single most important goal overall.
- This process helps in focusing efforts and resources on the most impactful actions.
- The speaker also introduces the concept of identifying "hard things" – tasks that are difficult but necessary for achieving the goals.
- She suggests committing to these hard things for a specific period to test their effectiveness and adjust the plan accordingly.
