In general, the number of plots that can fit into **1 acre** depends on the size of each plot. Here’s a breakdown based on common plot sizes:

- **For a 30x40 feet plot** (1,200 square feet):
  - **1 acre** = 43,560 square feet
  - Number of plots = $$ \frac{43,560 \text{ sq ft}}{1,200 \text{ sq ft}} \approx 36.3 $$
  - Therefore, approximately **36 to 37 plots** can fit in **1 acre** using this size[1].

- **For a smaller plot size**, such as **20x30 feet** (600 square feet):
  - Number of plots = $$ \frac{43,560 \text{ sq ft}}{600 \text{ sq ft}} \approx 72.6 $$
  - Thus, approximately **72 to 73 plots** can fit in **1 acre**.

- **For larger plots**, like **40x60 feet** (2,400 square feet):
  - Number of plots = $$ \frac{43,560 \text{ sq ft}}{2,400 \text{ sq ft}} \approx 18.15 $$
  - Hence, around **18 plots** can fit in **1 acre**.

### Summary
The number of plots in **1 acre** varies significantly based on the dimensions of the individual plots but generally ranges from about **18 to 73 plots**, depending on their size.
