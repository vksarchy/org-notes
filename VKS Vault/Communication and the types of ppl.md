Chase Hughes’ “six needs” model helps you profile what drives a person in any interaction. If you know their **primary social need**, you can communicate so they feel understood and valued. Here are the six needs, how to recognize them, _examples of how these people act in conversation_, and **what to give them** to connect or influence effectively:

---

## 1. **Significance**

- **Example:** “I’m the CEO of my company.” “I just got back from speaking at a big event.”
    
- **What to Give:** Recognition of the _difference_ they make. Compliment their impact, legacy, or unique status. Emphasize how your proposal will increase their status or footprint.
    
    - _Phrase to use:_ “You have a remarkable impact—this decision will double your reach and influence.”
        

## 2. **Acceptance**

- **Example:** “Our team did this together.” “We all went on vacation.” “We, us, our,” group language.
    
- **What to Give:** Make them feel like part of a group, express unity, talk about teamwork and shared goals.
    
    - _Phrase to use:_ “We’ll achieve more by working together—you belong in this circle.”
        

## 3. **Approval**

- **Example:** “I have to get on stage, but I’m really nervous and might mess up.” Seeks reassurance.
    
- **What to Give:** Affirmation and encouragement, direct compliments for their efforts, reassurance that they’re doing great.
    
    - _Phrase to use:_ “You did an amazing job last time—you absolutely have what it takes.”
        

## 4. **Intelligence**

- **Example:** “I actually got my MBA at Harvard.” “I did my thesis on this.” Highlights credentials, likes deep topics.
    
- **What to Give:** Compliment their intellect, expertise, “outside-the-box” thinking. Show your idea is _smart_, unique, or advanced.
    
    - _Phrase to use:_ “Few people see things with your level of insight—this approach is tailored for sharp minds like yours.”
        

## 5. **Pity**

- **Example:** Shares stories of struggle or suffering, wants recognition for overcoming hardship.
    
- **What to Give:** Acknowledge their resilience, express admiration for what they’ve overcome. Never belittle their struggle.
    
    - _Phrase to use:_ “What you’ve accomplished—given all you’ve been through—is truly extraordinary.”
        

## 6. **Strength/Power**

- **Example:** Talks about being in control, leadership, managing others, or demonstrates dominance/authority.
    
- **What to Give:** Acknowledge their leadership and control, offer choices, show how your plan gives them more control or influence.
    
    - _Phrase to use:_ “This puts you in the driver’s seat—your leadership will be what drives this to success.”
        

**Tip:** Listen for these cues in conversation—the language, stories, and focus of a person reveal their core need, telling you exactly how to connect or influence. When you give them _their_ “reward,” their resistance drops, trust rises, and your communication becomes highly effective.[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvjR9GM2kX8&t=366s)[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvjR9GM2kX8&t=366s)
