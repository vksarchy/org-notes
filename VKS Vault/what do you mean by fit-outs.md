### **What Are Fit-Outs in Commercial Real Estate?**  
**Fit-outs** (or **interior fit-outs**) refer to the process of customizing and finishing an office space to make it functional and aesthetically suitable for a tenant’s business needs. Unlike basic construction (shell & core), fit-outs include **partitioning, flooring, lighting, furniture, HVAC adjustments, and branding elements**.

### **Types of Fit-Outs in Office Spaces**  

#### **1. Shell & Core (Landlord’s Work)**  
- The **base structure** (walls, ceilings, basic plumbing, electrical wiring).  
- **No interior finishes**—tenant must install everything.  
- Common in **Grade A buildings** (e.g., IT parks on OMR).  

#### **2. Category A (Basic Fit-Out)**  
- **Landlord provides**:  
  - Raised floors & false ceilings  
  - Basic lighting & HVAC  
  - Fire safety systems  
  - Restrooms & common areas  
- **Tenant adds**: Furniture, branding, IT infrastructure.  

#### **3. Category B (Full Fit-Out / Tenant Customization)**  
- **Tailored to tenant’s needs**:  
  - Workstations, meeting rooms, breakout zones  
  - Branded interiors (paint, logos, themed designs)  
  - Specialized flooring (carpets, vinyl, hardwood)  
  - Tech upgrades (video conferencing, smart lighting)

### **Why Fit-Outs Matter in Chennai’s Office Market**  
✅ **Grade A vs. Grade B Differences**  
- **Grade A**: Landlords often provide **Cat A fit-outs** to attract MNCs (e.g., Pre-wired IT cabling in OMR offices).  
- **Grade B**: Tenants usually handle **full fit-outs** (common in Velachery/Ambattur for SMEs).  

✅ **Flexible Offices**  
- Coworking spaces (like **WeWork, SmartWorks**) offer **plug-and-play fit-outs**—no tenant investment needed.  

✅ **Cost Implications**  
- **Cat A fit-out cost**: ₹800–1,200/sq.ft. (landlord covers this).  
- **Cat B fit-out cost**: ₹1,500–3,000/sq.ft. (tenant pays).

### **Fit-Out Negotiation Tips for Tenants**  
1. **Rent-Free Period**: Ask for **2–3 months** to complete fit-outs.  
2. **Landlord Contributions**: Some offer **fit-out allowances** (e.g., ₹500/sq.ft. subsidy).  
3. **Lock-in Trade-off**: Agree to longer lease terms for **free fit-outs**.

### **Chennai-Specific Fit-Out Trends**  
- **OMR/IT Corridor**: Move-in-ready Cat A spaces dominate (for quick MNC occupancy).  
- **SME Hubs (Porur, Ambattur)**: Tenants prefer **bare shells** to customize cheaply.
