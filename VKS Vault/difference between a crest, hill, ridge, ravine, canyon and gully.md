### **Hill:**

A raised area of land with a distinct summit. It's higher than the surrounding terrain but smaller than a mountain.

### **Ridge:**

A continuous elevated landform with a series of peaks or high points. Think of it as a stretched-out hill with multiple crests.

### **Crest:**

The highest point along a ridge or hill. It’s where the slope starts to descend on either side.

**Tactical Note:**

- **Stay below the crest** to avoid skylining.
- **Use the military crest**, which is slightly below the top, to observe and move without exposure.
- **Hills** offer elevation for overwatch and defense, while **ridges** provide extended vantage points and cover for movement.
### **Ravine:**

A deep, narrow cut in the terrain, usually formed by running water. It’s steeper and smaller than a valley but larger than a gully.

### **Tactical Considerations:**

- **Cover & Concealment:** Provides natural defilade but can become a trap if ambushed.
- **Mobility:** Steep walls may slow movement and limit maneuverability.
- **Chokepoint Danger:** Enemy forces can use it to channel movement into a kill zone.

In short: Good for hiding, bad for getting out quickly under fire.

### **Canyon:**

A deep, wide valley with steep, often vertical sides, usually carved by a river over time. Think **Grand Canyon**—big, deep, and difficult to cross.

### **Gully:**

A small, narrow ditch or channel created by water erosion. It’s shallower than a ravine and often dry except during heavy rain.

### **Tactical Considerations:**

- **Canyon:**
    
    - Offers **strong cover** but limits movement.
    - Can be a **natural fortress** or a **death trap** if the enemy controls the high ground.
    - Usually only a few exit points—predictable routes.
- **Gully:**
    
    - Provides **temporary cover** for movement.
    - Easy to traverse but can become a **mud pit** in bad weather.
    - Can serve as a **concealed approach route** if not watched.

**Rule of thumb:** If it’s deep and wide, it’s a **canyon**. If it’s shallow and narrow, it’s a **gully**.
