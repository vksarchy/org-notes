### **Assets vs. Elements** (Tactical Context)

**Assets** – Resources or capabilities **available for use**. Can be personnel, equipment, intelligence, or support elements.

> _Example: Air support, UAVs, armored vehicles, and trained personnel are assets._

**Elements** – **Subunits or components** within a larger structure. Usually refers to **teams, squads, or operational groups**.

> _Example: A platoon has multiple fireteam elements. A convoy has security and logistics elements._

**Key Difference:**

- **Assets** = Tools & resources. _(What you have.)_
- **Elements** = Organized subgroups. _(Who’s executing.)_
