Here are some excerpts from _God Is the Light_ by Paramhansa Yogananda:

1. **"The sun shines equally on a diamond and a charcoal briquette, yet only the diamond reflects its light. Likewise, God's light is ever present, but only a pure heart reflects it fully."**
    
2. **"You do not have to beg for divine light—it is already within you. You must only remove the veils of ignorance that block its radiance."**
    
3. **"Darkness has no independent existence; it is merely the absence of light. Similarly, fear, doubt, and suffering disappear the moment you bring the light of God into your consciousness."**
    
4. **"Meditation is the process of turning off the flickering candle of the ego and allowing the sun of divine wisdom to shine through you."**
    
5. **"True vision does not come from the eyes but from the soul. To see God’s light, one must first close the physical eyes and open the inner eye of intuition."**

1. **"The wave is nothing but the ocean; the individual soul is nothing but God's light expressing itself in form."**
    
7. **"A room that has been dark for thousands of years is instantly filled with light the moment a lamp is lit. So too, the darkness of ignorance disappears when the light of God enters the heart."**
    
8. **"To seek God merely in temples and rituals is like searching for the sun at midnight. His light shines always—within and around you."**
    
9. **"Even in the darkest night of suffering, a single spark of divine remembrance is enough to set the soul ablaze with joy."**
    
10. **"The closer you move toward God’s light, the less the shadows of delusion can touch you."**
    
11. **"You are not a beggar at the door of divine light—you are a child of that light. Claim it as your own!"**
    
12. **"Those who carry the light of God within them do not stumble, nor do they fear the unknown, for they walk in eternal radiance."**
    
13. **"Love is the light that dissolves all walls between souls, families, and nations."**
    
14. **"The flame of divine wisdom does not flicker in the winds of doubt; it burns steady in the stillness of inner communion."**
    
15. **"When you think of God, imagine Him as an infinite light shining in all directions, warming your heart, illuminating your mind, and dissolving all darkness within you."**
