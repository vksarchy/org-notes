what is defeat? 
Only when we give up the spirit of fighting and the other person's rule has been imposed on us. only when these 2 clauses are met, we are defeated. 
What is moving on? 
When do we move on and say this fight is not worth it, when the clauses: 
a) We completey know for a fact that we can win, stronger than the opponent
b) different vector and unsure about what we are getting into
we can go on minding our business. 

Therefore , if someone chalenges us in our own game, we must not accept defeat, rather keep fightning till we win. 

THis should be like a command line entered into a robot about winning.
