### **1. How to Think Like Tywin Lannister**
---

- **Power is everything.** If you do not command respect, you are nothing. Strength must be projected, not begged for.
- **Legacy is the only true currency.** Wealth, status, and power mean little if they do not endure past your lifetime.
- **Loyalty is a tool, not a given.** People serve you because it benefits them. Make sure their best interest aligns with yours.
- **Emotions are for the weak.** Sentimentality clouds judgment. Pity and love make you vulnerable.
- **Efficiency over kindness.** The world is not fair, so fairness is irrelevant. Get things done, no matter how brutal the means.

### **Final Thought**

If you want to embody Tywin Lannister, remove hesitation, eliminate sentimentality, and always think five moves ahead. Ask yourself in every situation: **Does this make me stronger, or does it weaken me?** If it weakens you, discard it. If it strengthens you, seize it—by any means necessary.
