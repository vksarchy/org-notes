### **2024-10-21**

A recent article highlights the growing trend of Global Capability Centres (GCCs) expanding beyond Chennai into tier-2 and tier-3 towns in Tamil Nadu. Here are the key points:

- **Growth of GCCs**: Tamil Nadu hosts over 350 GCCs, primarily in Chennai, with more than 25 in Coimbatore and additional centres in cities like Salem, Vellore, and Madurai. Approximately 50 GCCs operate outside Chennai, employing over 225,000 professionals statewide.

- **Reasons for Expansion**: Companies are increasingly attracted to smaller towns due to a large talent pool, lower operational costs, and supportive local ecosystems. For example, Bosch Global Software Technologies chose Coimbatore for its skilled workforce and industrial base.

- **Collaboration with Academia**: GCCs are forming partnerships with local educational institutions to align curricula with industry needs, enhancing workforce readiness.

- **Economic Impact**: The emergence of GCCs in smaller cities is stimulating local economies and creating new job opportunities. The Tamil Nadu government is facilitating this growth by establishing Neo-Tidel parks for high-quality office space.

- **Market Dynamics**: Mature GCC hubs face high competition for talent, leading to increased costs. In contrast, tier-2 cities offer more affordable options for both talent and operations.

Overall, the shift towards tier-2 towns marks a significant evolution in the GCC landscape in India, as these centres evolve from back-office operations to hubs of innovation and strategic development.
