## Real-World Success Case: “Zero-Capital Land Deal to Multi-Crore Empire”

### 🎯 Case: **Subodh Jain – Indore to Chennai Land Aggregator Turned Builder**

#### Background:

- No capital, but a strong network and understanding of real estate legalities
    
- Identified outskirts of Chennai (like Oragadam, Sriperumbudur, Avadi) where industrial and logistic demand was growing
    
- Used **registered sale agreements with extended payment timelines** (90–120 days)
    

#### How he did it:

1. **Secured 3+ acre parcels** via unregistered _Memorandum of Understanding_ (MoU) with clear “no possession” terms.
    
2. Made site visits with potential investors — used _the land as leverage_, not ownership.
    
3. Took those agreements and projected plans to NBFCs and private investors.
    
4. Created an **SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle)** company, raised ~30% funds from angel investors.
    
5. Used **bridge loans** and converted them to a **bank construction loan** once development approvals came in.
    
6. Made profits via:
    
    - Land appreciation
        
    - JV deals with construction firms
        
    - Leasing to warehouses and manufacturing units
        

#### Results:

- From zero investment → created 15+ crore in land value
    
- Now owns warehouses rented to Amazon/Flipkart
    
- Most of his deals were done using **Agreement to Sell + private funding + NBFC support**
