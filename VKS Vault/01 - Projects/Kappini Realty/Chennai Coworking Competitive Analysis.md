### **Slide 5: Market Gap Analysis**  
**Untapped White Space:**  
1. **Specialized Vertical Hubs:**  
   - No dominant player for **healthtech, cleantech, or media production** (soundproof studios, labs).  
2. **Tier-2/Tier-3 Micro-Markets:**  
   - Demand surge in **Ambattur, Guindy** – 90% supply concentrated in OMR/CBD.  
3. **Integrated Flex Solutions:**  
   - Lack of **"space-as-a-service"** (rental + HR/fintech tools) for SMEs.  
4. **Premium Hybrid Tier:**  
   - Gap between WeWork’s corporates and iKeva’s SMEs for **scaling startups**.

### **Slide 7: Key Takeaways**  
1. **Consolidation is inevitable** – target acquisition of community-driven players (e.g., 91Springboard).  
2. **Differentiate or perish** – winners will own vertical niches, not generic space.  
3. **Tier-2 is the next battleground** – first-mover advantage in Ambattur/Guindy critical.  
4. **Tech integration > square feet** – invest in AI space optimization tools, not just real estate.
