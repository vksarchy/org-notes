1. Operations 
A roadmap of the strategies implemented and why? 
==Nov - Dec 23'== 
Decided to go with a luxury coworking space. A best in class amenities with a hotel like luxury experience & charge the clients accordingly. 
Because our identity (AMG group) is about giving the best possible experience in the most  luxurious & customer friendly way. 
The customers get more for what they pay for has always been the case with our clientele. 
PFA: The client feedback from AMG Towers .

Now as we studied the market, we found out that the best way to take back the returns was to cut down the expenses. 
* Why? - It turns out that most of the coworking spaces on the luxury, premium end - where the tariff was high was not fully occupied. It had an occupancy rate of about 70-80%, leading them to cut down or give the customers discount on their tariff accordingly. 
* How? - We can cut down the expenses by hiring the best in class architects and out of the box thinking engineers to cut down the construction cost. Bring in - AMG (The founder of AMG Group). He with his team of 4, ensured that the construction cost was cut down by a massive 45% of the estimated projection. 
* Things changed? - 

2. Operations. 
A good company makes profit by not selling more, but by keeping it's employees happy and making them feel inclusive. The employees need to take ownership of the company. They need to feel that sense of ownership.
