33 cents - MINE 
Of course, me winning this case and setting foot on the land that once was fraudulently taken away from us, is a pure victory, for us & most importantly - for my Mother - Padmavathy. 
My father could have made the mistake, but as a son or because of my will, I will right the wrong and enjoy the ownership, the rightfulness of the passing of ownership , true ownership. 
That piece of land, where I can cultivate fresh vegetables, I can plant trees, i can play with my dogs, train my dogs, build a hen for my pet animals, rent out the land for passive income. 
I can build a farm house, I can build a barn, breathe the fresh air, drink coconuts from the coconut trees planted there, My coconuts... 
After all the hardships endured, we emerge victorious. 
We are the masters of - Taking up mountains and breaking down things into its fundamentals and building from there - [[First Principles Thinking]]

Just now heard the backstory of the 33 cents. 
Selvaraj peripa had given 5L to Dad to settle to Mr. Mohan (Mayflower) Flat here in Cbe. But Vijayakumar made a rotation and that resulted in a loss. So, a rift happened between them, and so Dad gave a north facing property (Behind my 10 cents) to Chinnasaamy for 7.5L and settled that. After settling that to Peripa and trying to recover the loss incurred from the rotation, he went to that financer Shanmugasundaram, who gave 10k in cash and got 2 cheques under my mother's name for 5L. (2.5 x 2).
Then he misused that power and registered the land given in power in his nephew's name Varadhrajan. 
Then he gave power to his lawyer - Shaktivel Babu (for 40L) and got the advance, and cancelled the power the next day. 
Unfortunately Shaktivel Babu passed away, not getting back any money from Shanmugasundaram.
Then he somehow registered this land under his name. 
Then all this happened and then I came as his punishment for his wrongdoings.
