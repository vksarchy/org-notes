### **Summary & Key Takeaways**

This document outlines an optimized nighttime routine designed to enhance sleep quality. The author details a structured system involving meal timing, light exposure, post-dinner movement, environmental adjustments, and screen usage. The core idea is to create conditions that align with natural circadian rhythms, reducing sleep disruptors like artificial light, caffeine, and EMFs while maximizing factors that support restorative sleep.

### **Key Takeaways:**

1. **Meal Timing & Composition**
    
    - Dinner is eaten 2-3 hours before sleep.
    - Foods that support sleep: grass-fed beef (glycine for cooling), honey (stabilizes blood sugar), raw milk (tryptophan for melatonin).
    - Foods to avoid: caffeine, chocolate, processed sugar, alcohol, and seed oils.
2. **Post-Dinner Routine**
    
    - A light walk after dinner aids digestion.
    - No alcohol or marijuana, as both negatively impact sleep architecture.
3. **Light Hygiene**
    
    - No blue/white lights after sunset—house is lit only with dim red lights.
    - Screen time is minimized; screens are filtered with red-light modes.
    - Incandescent or zero-flicker red LEDs are preferred over standard LED lighting.
4. **Environmental Adjustments**
    
    - Sleeping in a **cool, dark, and quiet** environment.
    - No air conditioning—uses a cooling mat instead.
    - Blackout curtains & eye mask for darkness.
    - Earplugs for noise reduction.
    - No Wi-Fi—house is hardwired with Ethernet.
5. **Pre-Sleep Wind-Down**
    
    - No screens 1-2 hours before bed.
    - Reading (physical books) under red light.
    - Journaling mentally instead of using a device.
    - Lying with legs up against the wall for circulation and relaxation.
6. **Hygiene & Toxin Avoidance**
    
    - Uses **silk floss** (avoids plastic toxins).
    - Bamboo toothbrush (no plastic bristles).
    - No toothpaste—only brushes with water.
    - No soap/shampoo—believes they disrupt the microbiome.
    - Filtered water for drinking & showering (removes fluoride & chlorine).
7. **Big-Picture Concept**
    
    - Sleep quality starts in the **morning** with sunlight exposure.
    - Aligning with natural circadian rhythms leads to better hormonal balance, energy, and productivity.
    - Good sleep enhances job performance, libido, and overall well-being.

### **Action Plan:**

**Immediate Changes (Today - This Week)**  
✅ Eat dinner **2-3 hours** before bed—focus on whole, nutrient-dense foods.  
✅ Avoid caffeine, sugar, alcohol, and blue-light exposure at night.  
✅ Take a **10-15 min post-dinner walk** to aid digestion.  
✅ Install red-light filters on **phone & computer screens** (use apps like Iris).  
✅ Stop looking at screens **at least 1 hour before sleep**.  
✅ Implement **a bedtime wind-down routine** (reading, journaling, legs-up relaxation).

**Short-Term Goals (This Month)**  
🔲 Replace LED lights with **red incandescent or zero-flicker red LEDs**.  
🔲 Invest in blackout curtains & cooling solutions (fan, cooling mat).  
🔲 Switch to **silk floss, bamboo toothbrush, and fluoride-free hygiene products**.  
🔲 Hardwire internet (disable Wi-Fi at night).  
🔲 Ensure bedroom is **cool, dark, and quiet**.

**Long-Term Optimization (Ongoing)**  
🔲 Reduce EMF exposure—use **hardwired connections, avoid Bluetooth & Wi-Fi**.  
🔲 Optimize sleep by **tracking how quickly you fall asleep** (goal: <5 min).  
🔲 Continue refining **light hygiene, meal timing, and pre-sleep habits**.  
🔲 Strengthen morning sunlight exposure to reinforce circadian rhythms.
