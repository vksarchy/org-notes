[[Sadhguru wisdom on seeing things the way they are & thinking consciously]]


Right. Here’s a **minimal daily checklist** you can _plug and play_ into your life—no Himalayan cave required.

---

## 🧠 **Conscious Awareness & Thinking Checklist**

_5–15 min/day to rewire how your mind operates_

---

### **🕰️ Morning (1–3 mins)**

**Set the intent:**

> “Today I will observe. I will think only when needed. I will experience moments without judging them.”

(Optional: Stick this on your mirror.)

---

### **👀 Midday Anchor (2–5 mins)**

**Practice: One-Moment Awareness**  
Pick any ordinary task:

- Brushing your teeth
    
- Walking to the kitchen
    
- Washing your hands
    

Do it **without commentary**. No multitasking.  
Just **notice sensations**:

- The feel of water,
    
- The temperature,
    
- Your movement.
    

🧠 If your mind says something like:

> “I should reply to that message…”  
> Just say:  
> “Thinking. Not needed now.”  
> And return to the activity.

### **🧘 Evening (5 mins)**

**“Conscious Thinking” Session**  
Pick a small area of life:

- Tomorrow’s schedule
    
- A project you're stuck on
    
- A relationship issue
    

And **think ON PURPOSE.** Use paper or a voice memo.  
Ask:

- What do I _want_ to happen?
    
- What’s actually happening?
    
- What’s the next small step?
    

Once 5 mins are up—**drop it.**  
Don't carry the problem into your shower or bed.

---

### **🛏️ Pre-sleep (1 min)**

**Debrief:**  
Ask yourself:

- “Did I _see_ things clearly today?”
    
- “Did I _use_ my mind or did it use me?”
    

No judgement. Just noticing.
