Okay, here's a summary of the text, its key points, and an assessment of its applicability to the modern world:

**Summary**

This text presents Paramahansa Yogananda's teachings on developing "magnetism," which is defined as the power to attract goodwill, friends, and ultimately, divine connection. It emphasizes inner development, kindness, self-reform, and cultivating a connection with God as the source of true attractiveness and influence. It contrasts the Western focus on external beauty with the Eastern emphasis on inner qualities, advocating for a balance of both. The text also highlights the importance of good company, deep attention, and attunement with spiritually realized individuals to accelerate one's own spiritual growth. Trials and tribulations are presented as opportunities for self-improvement and strengthening one's inner self.

**Key Points**

- **Magnetism is Inner Attractiveness:** True magnetism stems from one's thoughts, feelings, responses, and motivations.
    
- **Kindness is Essential:** Unkindness is a spiritual disease, and being kind to others, even in the face of their negativity, is crucial.
    
- **Self-Reform is Paramount:** Focus on improving oneself rather than trying to reform others. Example is the most powerful teacher.
    
- **Balance Inner and Outer:** While external appearance matters, inner beauty and spiritual development are more important.
    
- **Cultivate the Inner Self:** Develop beautiful thoughts and feelings to beautify the eyes and overall presence.
    
- **Trials as Opportunities:** Use challenges as opportunities for self-improvement and to unlock inner strength.
    
- **Good Company and Deep Attention:** Surround yourself with positive influences and focus your attention to draw on the magnetism of others.
    
- **Attunement with the Divine:** Connect with God through meditation and love to access the ultimate source of magnetism.
    
- **God is the Supreme Magnet:** Love God unconditionally, and his divine magnetism will attract everything you need.
    

**Will this Philosophy Work in the Current World?**

Whether this philosophy or life path will "work" depends on your definition of success and what you are seeking to achieve. Here's a breakdown of its potential benefits and challenges in today's world:

**Potential Benefits:**

- **Improved Relationships:** Cultivating kindness, understanding, and compassion can lead to stronger and more fulfilling relationships, both personal and professional. This is valuable in any field, including consulting, where building rapport is key.
    
- **Increased Influence:** Developing inner confidence and a genuine desire to help others can make you more persuasive and influential, which is a great asset in the world of consulting.
    
- **Greater Resilience:** Viewing challenges as opportunities for growth can build resilience and help you navigate the stresses of a demanding career.
    
- **Enhanced Well-being:** Focusing on inner peace and spiritual connection can improve your overall well-being and reduce stress.
    
- **Stronger Ethical Foundation:** The emphasis on kindness, self-reflection, and moral development can provide a strong ethical foundation for your actions in the business world.
    

**Challenges:**

- **Practicality:** Some aspects of the philosophy, such as dedicating significant time to meditation or seeking out spiritually realized individuals, may be challenging to integrate into a busy consulting schedule.
    
- **Conflicts with Materialism:** The emphasis on inner development may conflict with the materialistic values often prevalent in the business world.
    
- **Naiveté:** Unconditional kindness and a lack of critical judgment could be exploited in a competitive environment.
    
- **Potential for Misinterpretation:** The concept of "magnetism" could be misinterpreted as a manipulative tactic rather than genuine inner development.
    

**How to Make it Work for You (Especially as a Young Consultant):**

- **Adapt, Don't Adopt Blindly:** You don't have to adopt every aspect of the philosophy wholesale. Focus on the principles that resonate with you and find practical ways to integrate them into your life.
    
- **Start Small:** Begin with small, manageable changes, such as practicing mindfulness for a few minutes each day or making a conscious effort to be kinder to your colleagues.
    
- **Focus on Authenticity:** The key is to be genuine in your efforts to develop inner qualities. People can sense insincerity.
    
- **Balance Idealism with Realism:** Maintain a healthy dose of realism and critical thinking.
    
- **Define Your Own Success:** Determine what "success" means to you. If it includes inner peace, meaningful relationships, and making a positive impact, then this philosophy can certainly contribute to your success.
    
- **Don't be afraid to be different**: In a world of young consultants trying to be the same, having a different perspective on life is a great way to stand out.
    

In conclusion, Paramahansa Yogananda's teachings offer valuable insights into developing inner strength, kindness, and a sense of purpose. While some aspects may require adaptation to fit the demands of the modern world, the core principles can certainly contribute to a more fulfilling and successful life, both personally and professionally, for a young consultant like yourself.
