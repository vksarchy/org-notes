# Difference between 21, 22, 23 SAS: 

The Special Air Service (SAS) regiments within the British Army are differentiated primarily by their status as either regular or reserve units, their roles, and their operational structures. Here's a breakdown of the differences between 21 SAS, 22 SAS, and 23 SAS:

  22 SAS (Regular SAS):

- Status: Full-time, regular Army unit.
    
- Role: Primarily involved in counter-terrorism, hostage rescue, direct action, special reconnaissance, and other high-risk operations. They are considered a Tier 1 special forces unit.
    
- Structure: Comprises four operational "sabre" squadrons (A, B, D, and G), each with specialized skills like mountaineering, parachuting, amphibious operations, or mobility operations. Each squadron has about 65 members and is further divided into troops.
    
- Selection: Candidates undergo one of the world's toughest selection processes, which includes physical endurance tests, navigation, combat survival, and tactical training.  

21 SAS and 23 SAS (Reserve SAS):

- Status: Part-time, Army Reserve units. These regiments operate under the Special Air Service (Reserve) (SAS(R)).
    
- Role:
    
    - 21 SAS: Based in London and the Southeast, formerly the Artists Rifles.
        
    - 23 SAS: Covers the North of England. Both are independent entities but work closely with 22 SAS. They are involved in roles like Human Environment Reconnaissance and Analysis (HERA), long-range reconnaissance, and sometimes assist in counter-terrorism or other operations when needed.
        
    - In recent years, they have been involved in support roles, including intelligence gathering, training local forces, and providing support to regular SAS operations. They were moved from UKSF to the 1st Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Brigade in 2014, but returned to UKSF by 2019.
        
- Structure: Both regiments are staffed by civilian volunteers except for senior ranks who might come from 22 SAS. They have their own command structures but can be integrated with 22 SAS for operations.
    
- Selection: While still rigorous, the selection process for 21 and 23 SAS is adjusted for reservists. It involves weekends and extended training periods rather than full-time. The selection tests military skills, fitness, and resilience but is tailored to allow for part-time commitments.
    
- Training and Deployment: Reservists undergo periodic training to maintain their skills, including Military Annual Training Tests (MATTs). They can be mobilized for operations, often in support roles or as casualty replacements for 22 SAS.

Key Differences:

- Operational Commitment: 22 SAS members are full-time soldiers, while 21 and 23 SAS members are part-time, balancing civilian life with military service.
    
- Primary Focus: While 22 SAS is directly involved in frontline, high-risk operations, the reserve units tend to have a broader, sometimes support-focused role, although they can undertake frontline duties when required.
    
- Selection and Training: The intensity and frequency of training are adjusted for reservists, acknowledging their part-time status.
    
- Operational Use: 22 SAS often leads in operations, whereas 21 and 23 SAS might be used for specific tasks or in support capacities, or to provide additional manpower.
 
In summary, while all three units share the SAS ethos and undergo similar, though not identical, selection processes, the primary differences lie in their operational roles, commitment levels, and the integration into regular versus reserve army structures.
