	Dry cladding, also known as mechanical cladding or rainscreen cladding, is a construction method where an outer layer of material is attached to a building's exterior using a mechanical fastening system, such as metal anchors, clips, or a framing system. Unlike "wet cladding" which uses mortar or adhesives, dry cladding creates a cavity or air gap between the cladding material and the structural wall.

Here are some dry cladding examples and who prefers it:

**Examples of Dry Cladding Materials:**

- **Natural Stone:** This is a very common application for dry cladding, especially with materials like granite, marble, travertine, and limestone. The stone is typically cut into slabs or panels and then mechanically fixed to the building. This allows for expansion and contraction of the stone without cracking.
    
    - **"Dry Stack" or "Dry Stone Cladding":** This refers to natural stone cladding installed without visible grout lines, creating a traditional, organic, and rustic look.
        
    - **Z-panels/Stacked Stones:** These are pre-assembled panels of smaller stone pieces (often with a Z-shape for interlocking) that can be easily installed to achieve a dry-stacked appearance.
        
- **Terracotta Cladding:** Terracotta panels are fired clay elements that offer excellent thermal insulation and weather resistance. They are often used as rainscreens and can come in various colors and textures.
    
- **Metal Cladding:**
    
    - **Aluminum Cladding:** This can include solid aluminum panels, aluminum composite panels (ACPs), or extruded boards. It's lightweight, durable, waterproof, and comes in various finishes.
        
    - **Zinc Cladding:** Available in forms like shingles, cassette panels, and flat-lock panels, zinc cladding is durable, long-lasting, and often combined with other metals for enhanced properties.
        
- **Fibre Cement Cladding:** Made from Portland cement, sand, water, and cellulose fibers, this type of cladding is non-combustible, rot-free, and low-maintenance. It can mimic the look of wood or other materials.
    
- **Timber Cladding:** While some timber cladding can be installed directly, dry-fixed timber systems often involve a battened system that creates a ventilated cavity. Popular choices include IPE, thermoash, and Wood Plastic Composites (WPC).
    
- **High-Pressure Laminate (HPL) Cladding:** These are homogenous panels made from thermosetting resins reinforced with cellulose fibers. HPL is known for its visual appeal, ease of maintenance, and fire safety properties, making it popular for commercial and hospitality projects.
    
- **Porcelain Slabs:** Large-format porcelain slabs are increasingly preferred for their sleek, seamless finishes, natural material composition, durability, low water absorption, and resistance to heat, frost, and UV rays.
    
- **3D Wall Panels:** These can be made from various materials (wood, stone, granite, glass effects) and are designed to create a three-dimensional appearance on exteriors.
    

**Who Prefers Dry Cladding?**

Dry cladding is generally preferred by:

- **Architects and Designers:**
    
    - They appreciate the aesthetic versatility and modern appeal, allowing for clean lines and diverse material expressions.
        
    - The ability to create a "rainscreen" effect with an air gap is crucial for modern building envelopes, offering improved thermal performance and moisture management.
        
- **Developers and Builders:**
    
    - **Projects with tight timelines:** Dry cladding systems can often be installed faster than wet cladding because there's no need to wait for mortar or adhesives to cure. Many components are prefabricated off-site, speeding up on-site assembly.
        
    - **Projects in varying climates:** Dry cladding is less affected by weather conditions during installation (e.g., rain, extreme temperatures), making it a more reliable choice in diverse climates.
        
    - **Projects requiring long-term durability and low maintenance:** The mechanical fixing allows for expansion and contraction, reducing the risk of cracks and making individual panel replacement easier if damage occurs.
        
- **Building Owners and Occupants:**
    
    - **Those seeking enhanced thermal insulation:** The air gap created by dry cladding acts as a thermal barrier, contributing to better energy efficiency and reduced heating/cooling costs.
        
    - **Those in areas with extreme weather conditions:** The flexibility of dry cladding systems helps them withstand movement caused by temperature fluctuations, preventing damage.
        
    - **Those valuing a clean, unblemished aesthetic:** Dry cladding avoids the potential for discoloration or efflorescence that can occur with wet mortar.
        
    - **Those who prioritize sustainability:** Many dry cladding materials and systems contribute to green building practices through their production, recyclability, and energy-saving properties.
        
- **Commercial and High-Rise Buildings:** Due to the advantages in speed of installation, durability, and performance, dry cladding is often the preferred method for larger commercial, institutional, and multi-story residential buildings.
    

In essence, dry cladding is chosen for its **durability, flexibility, speed of installation, thermal performance, and aesthetic versatility**, particularly in modern construction where efficiency and long-term performance are key considerations.
