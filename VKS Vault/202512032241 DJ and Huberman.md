Key takeaways from this episode:

## Morning and evening routines

- Build an evening shutdown so the morning is automatic: lay out clothes, prep water, supplements, toothbrush, bag, keys, and car the night before to remove decision fatigue and chaos.[1]
- Wake at the same time every day (even after poor sleep) and execute a fixed 10–15 minute sequence of “micro-wins” immediately to start the day in control, not reactive.[1]

## “Selfish to be selfless” block

- Protect a non‑negotiable early block (e.g., 7–10 AM) for training, walk, shower, and setup before taking calls, messages, or social media so you can give “both barrels” to work and family later.[1]
- During that block, think only about becoming the best version of yourself physically and mentally; family and work benefit because you are sharper, calmer, and more resilient.[1]

## Physical training and standards

- Treat fitness as a lifelong duty, not a phase: 5 days per week focused on strength, power, mobility, and sprint work to maintain a “usable” body, not just aesthetics.[1]
- Use simple standards to stay ready: bodyweight bench for reps, deadlift with trap bar at 1.5–2× bodyweight, strict pull‑ups, broad jump at least your height, heavy farmer’s carries, and a strong plank.[1]

## Controlling inputs and posture

- ruthlessly control mental “inputs”: avoid social media and negative news early in the day, eliminate low‑value online arguments, and curate music/content that supports the state you need to walk into.[1]
- Use physical posture as a lever on mind: upright chest, head up, and purposeful movement reduce rumination and victim mindset far more than curled‑up, phone‑scrolling positions.[1]

## Work–family “threshold drills”

- Before leaving work, clear tasks and communications, then use a short drive and music to mentally rehearse exactly how you’ll show up at home (greeting kids, spouse, and first actions).[1]
- Protect a small but sacred evening window (e.g., 6–9 PM) for full‑presence parenting and partnership, supported by a daily 20‑minute walk with your spouse (10 minutes her turn, 10 minutes yours).[1]

## “Control the controllable” mindset

- In both combat and civilian life, focus only on what you can directly affect (preparation, attitude, physical readiness, schedule) and discard what you can’t (past, external opinions, randomness).[1]
- See yourself as an operator, not a victim: when overwhelmed, narrow your world to the next controllable action (one rep, one call, one conversation, one walk) and execute it with full intent.[1]

## Trauma, meds, and psychedelic therapy

- Years of injury, surgeries, TBIs, and heavy polypharmacy (pain meds, antidepressants, sleep meds, stimulants) can create a “fake normal” where you’re never truly sober or clear‑headed.[1]
- Medically supervised ibogaine plus 5‑MeO‑DMT (in clinical‑style settings outside the U.S.) can rapidly surface buried trauma, generate intense empathy for those you’ve hurt, and produce powerful “ego death” experiences—but they are not recreational and require serious screening and integration.[1]

## Post‑medicine life changes

- The medicine is a catalyst, not a cure: long‑term change came from rebuilding routines, training, marriage rituals, and systematically cutting toxic people and commitments from his life.[1]
- His benchmark for recovery is sobriety (no daily psych meds, no self‑medicating), consistent physical training, present fatherhood and husbandry, and using his story to keep other veterans and high‑stress professionals from suicide.[1]

## Building an “unbreakable” identity

- Unbreakable is not “invulnerable”; it’s the capacity to keep moving through extreme stress by stacking small controllable wins, sustaining physical readiness, and refusing to quit even when feeling helpless.[1]
- Resilience scales with standards plus community: high physical standards, clear non‑negotiables, brutally honest self‑assessment, and a tight circle that demands the best from you all reinforce each other.[1]

If you want, the next step can be:  
- a 7‑day “DJ‑style” morning + evening routine template you can copy, or  
- a simple version of his fitness test you can run at home without special gear.
