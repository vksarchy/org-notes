Here's a summary of the key points in stages to help you refresh your memory when returning to Cities: Skylines 2:

I. Function: Getting Your City to Work

1. Start with outside connections (roads, power, water)
2. Build a simple grid system (200x96m blocks recommended)
3. Zone for residential, commercial, and industrial areas
4. Provide essential services (healthcare, education)

II. Data: Understanding Your City's Needs

1. Monitor traffic flow and adjust road layouts
2. Balance the budget by managing expenses and production
3. Use the happiness meter to gauge citizen satisfaction
4. Check the demand meter for zoning need.
5. Utilize info views for detailed insights

III. Design: Urban Planning Principles

1. Context: Consider the natural environment and surroundings
2. Values: Determine what matters to your city (e.g., technology, environment)
3. History: Reflect on how the city's past shapes its development
4. Citizen flow: Plan for efficient movement with road hierarchy
5. Style: Choose an overall look (e.g., North American, European, or mixed)
6. Aesthetics: Focus on beauty and pleasing visuals

IV. Redevelopment and Expansion

1. Rezone areas for higher density as the city grows
2. Improve road networks and intersections
3. Create open spaces and parks for leisure
4. Balance industrial areas with office spaces to reduce pollution
5. Add pedestrian paths to improve walkability

V. Creating a Green City of the Future

1. Implement mixed-use zoning for better integration
2. Add green spaces and tree-lined paths throughout the city
3. Focus on education by building schools and a community college
4. Invest in modern, environmentally-friendly buildings
5. Balance development with natural areas

VI. Final Touches

1. Address remaining service needs (e.g., garbage management, healthcare)
2. Fine-tune traffic flow with road adjustments
3. Fill in gaps with trees and small parks
4. Ensure all city values are represented in the layout and services

🧠 Remember to constantly balance function, data, and design as you build and expand your city. Keep an eye on citizen happiness, budget, and overall aesthetics to create a thriving and beautiful urban environment.
