A good annual growth rate for a business can vary depending on the industry, stage of the business, and market conditions. However, general benchmarks for a "good" growth rate are:

### 1. **Small and Medium-Sized Businesses (SMBs):**
   - **10% to 25% annually**: This is considered a healthy growth rate for most small and medium businesses, especially in competitive markets. Growth above this can be considered exceptional, but sustaining it long-term may be challenging.

### 2. **Startups:**
   - **30% to 50% or more annually**: Startups, especially in the early stages, are expected to grow rapidly as they capture market share. Venture-backed startups often aim for even higher growth rates, particularly in technology or scalable service sectors.

### 3. **Mature Businesses:**
   - **5% to 10% annually**: For larger, more established companies, sustaining growth above 5% is often considered a strong performance, especially in stable or saturated industries.

### 4. **High-Growth Industries:**
   - In sectors like **tech**, **e-commerce**, or **renewable energy**, growth rates of **20% to 50%** or more annually are common due to rapid innovation, consumer adoption, and scalability.
  
### Key Considerations:
   - **Profitability vs. Growth**: Rapid growth may come at the cost of profitability. Businesses need to balance scaling with maintaining sustainable profit margins.
   - **Industry-Specific Benchmarks**: Growth rates vary significantly by industry. For example, growth in the **retail** sector may be lower than in **SaaS (Software as a Service)**.
   - **Economic Factors**: Inflation, market demand, and competition affect growth expectations. Adjust growth goals accordingly.

In general, a business aiming for consistent growth between 10% and 25% annually, without sacrificing profitability or quality, is on a good trajectory.
