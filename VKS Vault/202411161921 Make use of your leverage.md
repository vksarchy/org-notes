wow! what a great realisation.
what is my [[leverage]]? 
Good looks and connections. 
Work on it and work around it... 

Not crumbling into some safe space zone and not exploring (playing r6 & planning to become 🐐 in that), instead become what you were destined to be... 

you were meant to be a ppl's person ... rmbr? 
how many friends you had? how many ppl you met, how many still need you in your life? 
You have a power to impact other ppl's life...

Document (obsidian capture) it 
Use your leverage 
Words can transform anything
Will power
Not in your safe zone, break that coming back and chucking ppl out of your life... 


Explore, Experience, Tell stories 

U are trying to start a new habit now, when all you need is to polish out what you were given and bring out the best of it. 
You are a ppl person, you have the looks, the ability to attract, 

Never accept something and stop taking actions... 

You are the captain of your soul,
