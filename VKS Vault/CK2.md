The CK2 notes from watching playthroughs 

Diplomacy 
If they don't accept your alliance , 
Sway them, befriend them and star them , 
send your councillor to improve diplomatic relations with them. 

Vassal revolt , after crushing , put him in the prison, banished imprisonment, take his gold.
banish imprisoned , will banish the vassal and give you their money 
Click on a county and click the creaet new vassal, below the city portrait 

solomy 

From Demesne - 
From vassals - 

Militia trainign grounds 
Trade post 
Barracks 
Stables 
Silk road trade post 
Castle Shipyard (since we're a coastal region)


having more concubines ups your prestige a bit 
Silk road got plummeted

Shipbuilding tech should be equal to 1 or more to build ships
Galleys can be hired from mercenaries too  
Raise fleet from your vassals , thereby reducing your upkeep cost 
Now each galley can hold upto 100 troops 
For Embarking: 
	* Merge all the galleys into 1 and send it to a nearby friendly port 
	* Send all your men as one unit (combine them) and click on the embark button. 
	* You can also click on your men and send it to embark the ships without the galleys docking at the port, but it will take time. 
For Dismebarking: 
	* You go to a waterspace adjacent to the place to where you need to disembark, click on the unit and disembark them to the county. Note that if you do this way, your morale always gets low first, so bring them back to their fullest and then send your troops to war. 
	* Or disembark them similarly to how you embarked them. 
For Disbanding: 
Click on the Fleet and instead of disbanding them from wherever they are, send them to a nearby friendly port and disband, this way you save yourself by not losing galleys.

Dammm learnt a lesson the hard way. 
I pressed a strong claim for the pandya dynasty for somenoe in my realm, but he wan't my vassal, so ended up as an independent dynasty because: 
* Equal level title contested 
* Make him your vassal before pressing his claims 
	Rank of the title: If you pushed a claim for a title equal in rank to your own, the claimant will become independent upon winning

Don't forget to capitalize your duchies

Learnt the hard way that , once you siege your enemy territory it will automatically siege all the barony included in that county. - the cities, the mandir, all. There will be a red box around the dp of the barony sieging. 

Peasant revolt / vassal revolt are to be taken seriously and to be cut off at the initial itself. 

Only if they are in the prison the powerful vassal's title can be revoked. Else they'll go down with a fight, leading to uprising of many vassals. 

should have built the shipyard for maldives, incase you want them to travel here. 

keep a note of your demesne and give it to the right person.
