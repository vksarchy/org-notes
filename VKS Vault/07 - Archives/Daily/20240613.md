### Journal
##### 13:01
Take the bull by the horns. God given discrimination and will power. 
We are what we think we are. 
INJECT strong thoughts. Everything is a thought. 
“those who possess the power of realization that everything is thought. When you have yet to attain that realization, you have to keep applying will and positive affirmation until you make thought work for you.”
