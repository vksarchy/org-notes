In India's business landscape, several key trends are shaping the current environment across various sectors:

1. **Digital Economy Expansion**: India’s digital economy is on a rapid growth trajectory, now contributing around 11% of the GDP, and is projected to exceed 20% by 2026. This expansion is fueled by the increasing adoption of technology across sectors, including cloud computing, AI, and digital public infrastructure. Companies are leveraging India as a hub for Global Capability Centers (GCCs), which are driving innovation in areas like AI, IoT, and blockchain【9†source】.

The shift towards green technology is significant, with projections indicating the creation of millions of new jobs in renewable energy and sustainability-related fields by 2025. This trend is also reflected in the broader push for decarbonization and the adoption of renewable energy sources【9†source】.
