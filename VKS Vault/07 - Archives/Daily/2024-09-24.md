## Journal
Good morning ppl. What a wonderful and opportunistic day. 
Reading Napolean Hill and the wonders of the Subconscious mind and  the techniques to use it appropriately. 
	Command given to the subconscious mind with absolute FAITH , acts on those orders even though the orders have to be presented again and again through repetition, before they are interpreted by the subconscious mind. 

Thank you all. Great day. Going to sleep. Replace the habit.
