# DAILY NOTE
### *Thursday, September 26th, 2024*

## Journal
Good morning Lord Vin. Thank you for this amazing weather here in Chennai. Indeed a sight in the morn. Woke up at 5 am. Did my Energization excercises by my beloved Gurudeva - Paramahansa Yogananda, followed by Chest and Back workout (beginning). 

Affirmations by Shri Paramahansa Yoganand for Creating an Inner Environment for Success.

I am brave, I am strong, 
Perfume of success thoughts blows in me, blows in me. 
I am cool, I am calm
I am sweet, I am kind. 
I am pleased with all. 
I am charming, I am magnetic 
I wipe away all tears and fears 
I have no enemies, I am the friend of all.
