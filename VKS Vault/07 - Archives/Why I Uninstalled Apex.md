[[Reflect MoC]]


It is feeding my ADHD and way too distracting... 
Anything u do, u have to do it fully, give your heart and time... 
It is just going frenzy and my eyes pain and attention span is getting affected directly! 

I am going towards a systematic and mindful approach of whatever i do. In that way no games are helping me. It is the books i read and the inner conversations i have with myself are the ones helping me. 

Obsidian 
Writing 
Reading 
Inner conversations 

The above mentioned are the way for my systematic approach givning my time n heart. 
The rest are just pure distraction and making my mind go frenzy...
