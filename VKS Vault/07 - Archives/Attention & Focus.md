Super [[Discipline]] on focusing on these three - what + why + who
Excercise: 
Watching - waking up from a dream, like a character realizes i
Intention - Decision to have & to act. 
How, when? - that compexity creates more doubt, 

> [!NOTE]
> I have made the decision, and i am going to have it, i will do whatever is necessary from my end to act.

Start expanding your comfort zone.. 

Heart Mind Coherence 
Start telling stories and focus on them. Nothing more, till we get them, we focus on nothing more. 
[[control]] and [[Discipline]]

``He who has nothing to lose has everything to gain``

Let go, and be confident/know that your [[Visualization]] will be fruitful... 

ACCEPT & REDIRECT 
what do i like to have - focus on that. 
always the focus is on what i want. 

from the comments: 
Summary of this video in my point of view: 

1)Always believe whatever happened, happened for Good. 

2)Always motivate by the possibilities of Sucess. 
3) Be the person by heart first, who will live the life you want. 
4) whatever you focus become your reality. 
5) Universe is deaf ,blind , & dumb but Innocent & Kind, it's just communicate with your frequency whatever the frequency you are, it gives you that frequency stuff in huge amount. 
6) Just let your ship sail with the tide of live but always keep directing it with constant gaze at your northern star( dream life).
