1. Goals - Like Warren Buffest used to do - 25 goals, take the top 5 and throw the rest. 
2. Break the goals into Schedules and Habits 
3. Plan your next day the night before - ![[Pasted image 20240302173905.png]]
4. when feeling unmotivated or not knowing what to do - creativity jarrers - stare at a blank wall for 10 mins instead of mindlessly scrolling at your phone 
5. Deep Work - 90 mins - Rian Dorris 
6. Read, read read books
