Yet some of history's most famous leaders and creatives did their best work at night. Kafka sat down to write at 10:30 or 11:00pm and worked until 1, 2, or 3am. Other well-known night owls include Winston Churchill, Fran Lebowitz, Bob Dylan, Carl Jung, J.R.R. Tolkien, John Travolta, Prince, Christina Aguilera, and, believe it or not, Barack Obama.

"Listen to the night as the night knows your truths, your stories, your aches, your dreams, your cravings, your forgotten memories, not so forgotten."

Victoria Erickson

"I will always write.  
I will capture nights all over the world  
and bring them to you."  
  
Henry Rollins
