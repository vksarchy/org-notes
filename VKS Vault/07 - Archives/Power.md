A poem about power by ChapGPT 

**Morning Power**

Awake, arise, the dawn is here,  
The day is fresh, the path is clear.  
With steady breath, and focused mind,  
You hold the power, undefined.

The sun ascends, a golden flame,  
Each morning, life is not the same.  
What you achieve, what you create,  
Is born from courage, not from fate.

The world awaits your bold command,  
With open heart, with steady hand.  
The strength within, a boundless well,  
A silent force no fear can quell.

So stand up tall, embrace the day,  
With every step, carve out your way.  
For power’s not in grand display,  
But in the choices made today.

So trust the will that you possess,  
It grows in every faced distress.  
With every trial, it stands more tall,  
For will power is the strength of all.
