One of the main toosl mbs is using to push oyt of oil is Public Investment fund 
they are going crazy and investing in anything and everything 
so by doing this they decrease the spendings or filter the spendings not on the oil price, but from the profits they get through this investments. making it one of the largest private investors in the world 


Their latest investment is sports 

They are trying to brand themselves into luxury. Just like Canada which branded itslef to safe living and it worked for them 

### Workforce & Saudi Citizens 

95% of the public sector workforce are saudi citizens and thy earn an average of about the same as a canadian but are less educated. 
17% in private 

so the push isn't just to make or brand themsleves into luxury, but to make them work in smart/educated environment 

> [!NOTE]
> Saudi needs to become a highly skilled with high productivity programs 

===Restructuring the social contract - need to learn this ===
