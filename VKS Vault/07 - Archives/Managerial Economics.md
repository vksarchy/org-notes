#ME #econerd


Wow! Such a surreal experience…

 Was just asking the full moon what to do? What other things to focus, what to do next, am I fulfilling my purpose correct…? 

Then we started talking about starting any family business type of things… 

Enquired about what is the hot producing crop or resource in your town. She said all the SEASONAL crops… 

Rt now it was “Tapioca” we started making rough assumptions and dreaming… 

  

Seeing all this, the Moon in her full ecstatic, vibrant form - Sent the message to me..

  

ECONOMIST. 

  

Why did I put this down? Why did I not pursue this? 

  

Voila… I started making all the connections and to my surprise it all aligned perfectly.
