For me, it has always been - Distractions
It feels like they are pulling me down and taking me in the path other than the routed one. 
Is clearing that alone would work? - 90%
The rest requires focus and sheer [[Will Power]] - 10% 
What should I focus on more? The 90 or the 10 %? 
Well the 10% - Focus and Will power does have some leverage over the 90%.But the thing about the Distraction is that unless you know what are those trigger points, understanding them, you will not be able to destroy them using Focus and Will Power. 
I would suggest you to start with eliminating what you don't want and then implementing the focus and will power.
