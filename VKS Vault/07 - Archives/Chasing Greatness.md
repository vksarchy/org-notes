Passionate ppl are easy to work with. Obsessive ppl are not, because Obsession lives in your nightmare too. Every DETAIL matters. Passion is just a daydream. 


Master your Foundation - Average & Good
 
 Michael Jordan mastered the chest pass. WE HAVE TO MASTER THE FOUNDATION. If i lose my confidence, my foundation is not in place. Mastery of the average and mastery of the good has to be there. 3 things to master #mastery
 1. What is the concept? - what is it we're trying to convey...  
 2. Identity of the concept. The identity has to be the same.. identity never changes. Find out your identity.
 3. Master the Execution - done in practice way before that... Practice the execution wayyyy before that. 
The Greatest of the greats to them - thinking is a distraction - (FLOW). 

There is so much pleasure in the details. Most think it's monotonous. but it's not;

Talk is Cheap 

STFU. Listen first and then you say something.
If you say something, make sure there's some value to it. 

Stop using filters 
Be who you really are. 
Unfiltered, Raw

THE Company ; don't be a company 

OWN your weakness or it will own you 
we don't believe in weakness
Because weakness will cost you so f much.. 
Held your team or others to the same standard - highest level

The hardest thing for the individuals who are so driven is to be able to let go a little bit, to know what that weakness is n let go of it.. 

Feedback & Criticism 
Don't be embarrassed by rejection, by putting up a new concept 
Recognize it all as a new start of a conversation...

Excellence is lonely.
An ally is an individual that tells you what you need to hear not what you want to hear... 

Pressure is a Privilege
It makes you more 
- Talented
- Intelligent 
- Resilient 
- Competitive

If you deal with pressure situation everyday, then you don't have to deal with stress.
Don't let the Pleasure excel the Pressure.
For the top induviduals, the pressure is the pleasure... 
every individuals should be setting unrealistic goals and expect them to achieve it. 

You don't find balance, You create balance 
It's different for every individuals
The thing about Balance is about the decrease and not about the increase...
