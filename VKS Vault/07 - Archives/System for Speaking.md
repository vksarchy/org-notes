Effortless articulacy is proportionate to the size of your surface lexicon 
Effortless articulacy is limited to the size of your surface lexicon 

3. Thought retention 
If you can't retain your thought for more than 10 seconds, the lower your articulate skills. 
The longer you can engage your thought, the greater depth you can achieve with words. 

4. The quality of your speech is the product of your language environments 
5. 3X5 Diet 
- 5 mins of reading something above your language profeciency, reading poetry, consiously attuned to the word choice of an audio source... 
6. An admission of limitation is often the most articulate answer
