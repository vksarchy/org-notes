Why does it happen: ?

It's because you haven't quite become worthy of holding on that kind of money,
you haven't been accustomed to looking at 100k at your bank account
you feel uncomfortable when that happens 

"You internally need to become worthy enough to keep that... 
You need to expand your sense of identity"

How do we change ourselves at the being paradigm>?? 
##### 3 Main Beliefs 
3. Thought 
2. Belief - Unconsciously primes our RAS  - RAS gets programmed to our belief and we unconsciously look for evidence that support this belief  ![[Pasted image 20240222212924.png]]
The ego wants to live forever
4. Conviction 
- World View 
- Identity (Self View)
##### Affirmation - Confirmation cycle

We want to consciously choose our Beliefs 
1. We begin with the Affirmation and we look for proof for Confirmation

> [!NOTE]
> My Mind & my Heart needs to be IN CONGRUENCE. For me to experience that in my nervous system and accept it as my reality.

Quazi's Example:

==The 2 Statements:== 

![[Pasted image 20240222215107.png]]

1. World View Statement - How you relate your external world around you. 
![[Pasted image 20240222215015.png]]

2. When you have the correct identity, it kind of overrides your world view.  
![[Pasted image 20240222215257.png]]

> [!NOTE]
> It's best to have the world view statement and the identity statement be CONGRUENT to that goal you picked 12 months from now. 

NOW,  After your world view statement & identity statement, now go look out for PROOFS. 
Go to that BEING Paradigm.
