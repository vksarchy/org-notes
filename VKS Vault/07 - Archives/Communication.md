An important aspect of social skill is self-monitoring. Self-monitoring can be described as the ability to adapt one’s behavior to perform appropriately in social situations by assessing those situations

Socially skilled leaders perform better under stressful situations

Social skill in communicating includes expressivity (sending), sensitivity (decoding), and control (regulating communication), which occur in the verbal/social domain as well as the nonverbal/ emotional domain. A skilled communicator demonstrates expertise by balancing each of these three competencies across both domains.41 These skills are trainable and evolve with experience

Emotional intelligence represents the ability to: • monitor the emotions of self and others, • differentiate distinct emotions, • label emotions correctly, and • use this information to guide behavior.45 Leader-follower relationships are highly dependent on emotional intelligence

Leaders who arouse, inspire, and motivate followers via effective communication are typically demonstrating transformational leadership.28 This form of leadership is associated with more satisfied and higher performing groups.

### Principles of Effective Communication 

There are ways to increase the perceived credibility of the communicator. The first is to defend against or minimize perceived self-interest.  When it is perceived that the communicator stands to gain more from the communication than those who are receiving it, the information is often not effective. If the communicator is at least able to demonstrate a shared interest, he or she is more likely to be viewed as credible and the communicated information will be better received.

primacy - BLUF 
recency - Arguments made at the end are remembered well 
repetition -
credibility -

Ultimately, the best way to establish and maintain credibility is to ensure words are matched by actions; otherwise, the communicator is viewed as not credible.

### Forms of Communication

Leaders and communicators are judged based on three observable attributes: bearing, how the communicator engages with others, and words used for the interaction. Judgments based on bearing are made in the first 15 seconds
Looking down, random hand movements, shuffling of feet, licking lips, looking at objects versus people, and speaking in a monotone voice all cause an audience to disengage

### Lessons for Leaders and Communicators

The only reason to communicate is to change something—to provoke a reaction.
Communication is an act of will directed toward a living entity that reacts. An effective communicator never starts with “What do we say?” or “How do we tell our story?” but rather focuses on the goal:

• What is the goal: How will things be different when communication has taken place?
• Who is the audience: What does the audience care about now; what do we want the audience to care about when we’re done; what prevents the audience from caring about it?
• How should we engage the audience so that it does care?
• What does the audience need to see us do, hear us say, or hear others say about us in order to care about what we want it to care about?
• How do we make that happen?
