Poem about Control: 

In the quiet of the midnight hour,
Where shadows stretch and stars devour,
There lies a grip both firm and tight,
That wrestles dreams from darkened night.

Control, a force both soft and cold,
Commands the heart, the soul, the bold,
It pulls the strings of every breath,
And guides the path to life or death.

Yet in its grasp, the freedom fades,
As iron hands cast heavy shades,
Each choice becomes a choreographed dance,
Bound by fate’s unyielding stance.

In corridors of thought, it reigns,
In whispered doubts and subtle chains,
It molds the future, shapes the now,
With iron grip and solemn vow.

But is control a tyrant’s might,
Or a beacon in the endless night?
For in its power, we may find,
A map to navigate the mind.

Let balance be the guiding thread,
With freedom’s light, where shadows fled,
For control, when wielded with finesse,
Can lead to growth and to success.

In the end, it’s not just might we seek,
But harmony in both strong and meek,
To balance will and choice, unbound,
And let our spirits dance around.
