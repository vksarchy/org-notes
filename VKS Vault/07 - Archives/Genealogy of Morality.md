## Morality
Part 1 - What is [[Nietzsche project]]? 
It's one of liberation - liberate from Morality. Slave / Herd morality (egalitarian morality)
Pagan world Greco Roman world vs Christian world 
Instead of Altruism - develop severe kind of self love 
Instead of Tranquility - Embrace danger 
Instead of Compassion - Use it as instruments for your own ends.
Instead of Astheticism - indulge in your animalistic desires 
These are the core of his teachings and he calls this ``Revaluation Values``
## Higher Men 
Creative geniuses 
``Why is egalitarian morality harmful for the production of greatness? ``
## Ruthless
 Inegalitarian

Part 2
## [[Resentment]]
 Good & Evil vs Good & Bad 
 ambition becomes greed 
 appetite becomes gluttony 
 sexual prowess becomoes lust 
 confidence becomes pride 
 strength becomes wrath 
 Where does slave morality gets its concept of Good? 
 The slaves hold value not for themselves but as a moral weapon against their masters. 
 Master defines good in himself, whatever is not is bad. (Plain, simple, common, absence of something)
 Slave defines evil in the master and whatever is opposite of that is good.
 Change it by the 3 ways
 1. Pointing out to the internal psychology of the slaves. 
  Resentment - Critiques of slave morality .

  # The slaves inverse the system of morality but also add the notion of free will.

## Part 2 Summary 
Slave morality inverts the value of the masters and introduces the idea of free will which further blames the master, praises themselves. 

``Is resentment the essence of egalitarian movement or is it merely a likely perversion ? 

Part 3
## [[Asceticism]] Ideal 
Priests and slaves are sickly, 
they have neither the slave or masters have, they are smart, interesting, intelligent, 
The priets also have the Will to Power (Central theme of N)
![[Pasted image 20240629113033 1.png]]
We do more thing knowingly or unknowingly to increase the feeling of power. 
The priests are: 
Like the master - They have the strong will to power, 
Like the slave- They are sickly 
Like neither of them - They are intelligent/smart. 
The closest approximation to someone like the priest would be The Intellectuals today. 
Eg 
Tibetian Prostration - Selflessness, 
Willing Nothingness

Truth at all costs 
![[Pasted image 20240629114716 1.png]]
The truth at all costs gave birth to atheism and science. 
it destroyed Christianity. 
X at all costs is always bad, let alone truth, what sustains life is illusion and so the Truth is always going to be harmful. 

[[Willing nothingness ]]

Need for cruelty:

``HE WHO HAS A WHY CAN BEAR WITH ALMOST ANY HOW``

This video is a detailed lecture on Friedrich Nietzsche's work "On the Genealogy of Morality." Here's a breakdown of the key points:

1. Nietzsche's Project:
   - Nietzsche aims to produce "higher men" like Beethoven, Napoleon, and himself[1].
   - He believes slave morality is holding back the production of these higher men[1].
   - The goal is to show the perverse origins of slave morality to change people's tastes[1].

2. Master vs. Slave Morality:
   - Master morality is associated with the Greco-Roman pagan world, valuing strength, beauty, and power[1].
   - Slave morality is associated with Judeo-Christian values, emphasizing meekness, chastity, and compassion[1].
   - Nietzsche argues that slave morality inverted master morality out of resentment[1].

3. Resentment:
   - Nietzsche claims slave morality arose from the resentment of the weak towards the strong[1].
   - He uses the analogy of lambs resenting eagles to illustrate this point[1].
   - Slave morality introduces the concept of free will to blame the strong and praise the weak[1].

4. The Aesthetic Ideal:
   - Nietzsche discusses the "aesthetic ideal" of denying life's natural desires[1].
   - He argues that even this self-denial is an expression of the will to power[1].
   - The aesthetic ideal appeals to both slaves and masters by providing an outlet for cruelty and giving meaning to suffering[1].

5. Critique of Religion:
   - Nietzsche sees Christianity as a religion by victims, for victims, about victims[1].
   - He argues that Christian love is actually a form of vengeance[1].
   - Nietzsche claims that science and atheism are outgrowths of the Christian "truth at all costs" mentality[1].

6. Limitations of Nietzsche's Arguments:
   - The lecturer points out that Nietzsche may exaggerate the role of will to power in human nature[1].
   - Nietzsche's ideal of heroic individualism is criticized as naive and impossible[1].
   - The lecturer suggests that Nietzsche's own life experiences may have influenced his philosophy[1].

The lecture provides a comprehensive overview of Nietzsche's genealogy of morality, while also offering critical perspectives on his arguments. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the context and potential biases in Nietzsche's work.
