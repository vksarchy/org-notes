## Polyphasic Sleep 

E2 removes two cycles from monophasic, and adds two nap, each containing similar amounts of REM to the removed cycles. The core sleep of E2 has 3 full cycles of 90m each. By default, the first nap is scheduled at around sunrise, and another nap is scheduled in early afternoon. Two naps break the long day into shorter wake gaps, which helps the body sustain itself on reduced total sleep.

The wake gap between the core and the first nap should be the shortest, while the gap before core can be the longest because of higher alertness during late afternoon hours. The first nap can be between 3.5-5h after the core, and the last nap can have an 8-9h wake gap until the core.

The 4.5h core allows all [SWS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow-wave_sleep "wikipedia:Slow-wave sleep") needs to be met even during adaptation, since monophasic sleepers typically gain all the required SWS by the middle of the night, after their 3rd sleep cycle. The ideal core placement is around around midnight, for a good balance of REM and SWS pressures. It is recommended for the first nap to be placed the middle of the [REM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep "wikipedia:Rapid eye movement sleep") peak of 6-9AM, allowing high quality REM sleep for the nap. The second nap on E2 may only contain light sleep rather than REM sleep, especially if this nap is late into the afternoon (e.g, 4 PM onward).

In a polyphasic sleep schedule, the total amount of sleep per day is typically reduced compared to a traditional monophasic (single night-time sleep) schedule. The exact number of hours you sleep in a polyphasic schedule can vary based on the specific pattern you choose, but it generally ranges from 2 to 6 hours per day spread across multiple sleep periods (naps and a core sleep).

Here are a few common polyphasic sleep schedules along with their total sleep durations:

1. **Everyman 2 (E2)**:
   - **Total Sleep**: Approximately 4.5 hours per day
   - This schedule typically includes a 4.5-hour core sleep period supplemented with two 20-minute naps.

2. **Everyman 3 (E3)**:
   - **Total Sleep**: Around 3 hours per day
   - This schedule consists of a 3-hour core sleep period along with three 20-minute naps strategically spaced throughout the day.

3. **Uberman**:
   - **Total Sleep**: Just 2 hours per day
   - The Uberman schedule involves taking six 20-minute naps evenly spaced throughout the day, providing a total of 2 hours of sleep.

4. **Dymaxion**:
   - **Total Sleep**: Only 2 hours per day
   - The Dymaxion schedule, popularized by Buckminster Fuller, features four 30-minute naps, totalling just 2 hours of sleep per day.
