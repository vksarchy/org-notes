In the early 1970s, the British political system had settled into a comfortable
pattern: the Labour Party would win an election, and then, the next time around,
the Conservatives would win. Back and forth the power went, all fairly genteel
and civilized. In fact, the two parties had come to resemble one another. But
when the Conservatives lost in 1974, some of them had had enough. Wanting to
shake things up, they proposed Margaret Thatcher as their leader. The party was
divided that year, and Thatcher took advantage of the split and won the
nomination.
