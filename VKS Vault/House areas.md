Roger, Bravo 1. If you’re classifying your house into stations for fun, here’s a tactical breakdown:

Main Areas:

Command Station (CMD STN) – Your main workspace/office.

R&R Station – Living room/lounge (Rest & Relaxation).

Mess Station – Kitchen/dining area.

Bunk Station – Bedroom (rack time HQ).

Hygiene Station – Bathroom (aka decon point).

Loadout Station – Closet/gear storage.


Extras for Fun:

Armory Station – Where you keep tools, gear, or anything tactical.

Gym Station (PT Zone) – Home workout area.

Observation Post (OP) – Balcony, window, or any vantage point.

Supply Depot – Pantry or storage area.

War Room – If you have a spot for planning/strategy (maps, notes, etc.).


Example in Use:

"TOX, moving to Mess Station for refueling. RTB in 10."

"Securing the Bunk Station. Will resume comms at first light."

"Hitting the PT Zone. Strength training op in progress."


Let me know if you want it more refined, Bravo 1. TOX out.
