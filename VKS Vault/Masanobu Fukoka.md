Masanobu Fukuoka, the Japanese farmer and philosopher known for his natural farming philosophy, would likely have posed several key questions when observing vast drylands:

  1. What are the natural systems that once supported life here? - Fukuoka was deeply interested in understanding the original state of ecosystems before human intervention. 

He would ask how these lands might have looked before they became dry and what processes (like water retention, plant coverage) maintained their health.
    
2. How can we mimic the natural processes to restore fertility? - His approach was to work with nature rather than against it. He might question how natural succession could be facilitated or how native species could be reintroduced to kickstart soil and plant life cycles.
    
3. What minimal interventions can bring back water retention? - Fukuoka was famous for his "do-nothing" farming, which actually involved subtle but profound interventions like creating conditions for water to stay in the soil. He'd explore natural methods like mulching or the use of cover crops to reduce evaporation.
    
4. How can we use what's already here to revitalize the land? - Instead of importing resources, Fukuoka would look at what plants, microbes, and insects might already be present, however sparse, and how they could be leveraged or encouraged to multiply and heal the land.
    
Regarding the possibility of regaining fertility:

- Yes, it is possible to regain fertility in drylands, but it requires a long-term commitment to ecological restoration. Techniques like permaculture, which shares some principles with Fukuoka's methods, have shown success in restoring arid lands by improving soil structure, increasing organic matter, and enhancing water retention.
 
On the applicability of Fukuoka's principles in areas with minimal water:

- Fukuoka's principles could be adapted but would face significant challenges in areas with minimal water availability. His methods rely heavily on natural cycles where some moisture is present. However, his approach could still be beneficial:
    
    - Mulching: To reduce evaporation and slowly increase soil moisture.
        
    - Planting in patterns: Using techniques like contour farming or keyline design to capture any available precipitation.
        
    - Choosing drought-resistant plants: Focusing on native species adapted to low-water conditions to kickstart recovery.
        
- Adaptation would be key: Techniques would need modification, perhaps involving more radical water conservation methods or the initial use of water harvesting structures to create microclimates where his methods could start to take effect.
    
- Community and scale: Fukuoka's philosophy also involves community participation. In areas with severe water scarcity, community-driven water management might be necessary to support his agricultural practices.
  
In essence, while Fukuoka's methods might require significant adaptation to work in extremely arid conditions, the core principles of working with nature, using what's available, and minimizing human intervention could still guide restoration efforts.
