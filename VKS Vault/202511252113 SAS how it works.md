### *How The SAS Actually Works | Krishna Thapa (Insider): Deepest, All-Inclusive Breakdown*

#### **Background & Identity**
- Krishna Thapa: Former SAS troop leader, Gurkha, world-class mountaineer. Military career began in 1996 with Gurkhas, joined SAS in 2003 after passing an extremely tough selection process. Served 16 years in global conflict zones (Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq, Afghanistan), led the SAS Mountain Troop.
- First active-duty warrant officer to summit both Everest and K2 during service.

#### **SAS Selection Process (Every Stage in Detail)**
- **Hill Phase:** Brutal physical endurance, daily long-distance marches, heavy packs, navigation through mountainous terrain in adverse weather, sleep deprivation, constant self-motivation.
- **Jungle Phase:** Surviving, operating, and handling weapons in hot, humid conditions. Pressure builds with environmental challenges; focus shifts from just physical strength to adaptation, resilience, and resourcefulness.
- **Escape & Evasion:** Candidates are hunted while escaping in simulated hostile territory, sleep-deprived and physically exhausted. After capture, subjected to interrogations—must remember the rules: only authorized details allowed, neither break nor sign anything. Environment engineered for extreme stress: cold, darkness, hunger, psychological intimidation and trick questions.[1]
- **Observation / Psychological Testing:** Even minor mistakes (like incorrectly applied camouflage) mean instant failure. Instructors constantly monitor for discipline, initiative, judgment, sensitivity to detail.

#### **Training & Skills**
- Not just physical: Selection is designed to find those with true willpower, mental acuity, situational awareness.
- Candidates select “infill” specialties, e.g., mountain, boat, skydiving, driving etc. Not guaranteed desired track—must repeatedly prove ability. Thapa specialized in mountain warfare, eventually leading mountain troop.
- Training is relentless, repetitive, blindfolded drills, constant practice to cultivate extraordinary sensitivity and awareness—those who pass can detect minute anomalies swiftly.
- Kit, weapons: Use advanced Western weapons (M4, Glock 17), but must also adapt to local arms (AK-47 etc.) and environments for each mission.

#### **Regimental Life & Culture**
- Hierarchy is based on experience and contribution, not just formal rank. Every member starts as “Trooper”; team respect earned through proven skill, judgment, and input on missions.
- All decisions and mission planning are done collectively, round table—every voice matters, regardless of experience or rank, especially in smaller (four-man to six-man) teams. Input is shared and consensus formed.
- “Who Dares Wins” motto manifested through courage, adaptability, creative problem-solving, commitment to mission and team above self.

#### **Gurkha Roots**
- Gurkha traditions: Humility, discipline, courage, community. Thapa explains the Kukri’s symbolism: “Go” = sense, “Ka” = protector; Gurkha means someone who protects from within and masters challenges coming from outside.
- Blending cultural humility and service with SAS’s elite standards is both a challenge and a strength, as seen in Thapa’s career.

#### **Intense Missions**
- SAS missions have both “specified” and “implied” tasks. Operators must show plan, process and deliberate movement. Obligatory to offer three to four “courses of action” for each mission, with thorough planning and debate.
- Prepared for anything: From mountain rescues to covert urban ops to jungle survival.

#### **Psychological & Leadership Lessons**
- Leadership is not issued with rank, but forged in adversity, responsibility, and empathy.
- Success means understanding not just yourself but your teammates; learning the discipline to protect home/family and separate professional from personal.
- Emotional intelligence and humility are as critical as physical and tactical skills.

#### **Post-Service Life**
- Thapa became a leadership coach, motivational speaker, charity founder for Gurkha Welfare Trust and other resilience programs supporting veterans, disabled soldiers, disadvantaged youth.
- Advocates for transferring military lessons to civilian life: Adaptability, grit, service, teamwork.

#### **Ultimate SAS Operator Qualities**
- Willpower, mental fortitude, acute observation, adaptability, teamwork, cultural flexibility, and undying commitment to both mission and moral values.

#### **Special Takeaways & Anecdotes**
- Selection is so intense, people drop out due to fatigue, heat, psychological stress—only those with internal drive survive.
- Real test: How you function under sleep deprivation, stress, uncertainty, and interrogation.
- Team’s success depends on shared input and support, not lone heroics.
- Gurkha ethos grounded Thapa through every challenge—protection, service, humility above all.
