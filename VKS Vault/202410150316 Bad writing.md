What a lazy writing by Gnanavel 
Tamil cinema and its masala genre is screaming for help. 
Movies like Lubber Pandu are innovating at Commercial movies, with far lesser budget and great casting. 
Free version of ChatGPT can write gripping storyline than these. 
A few continuous flops in this genre, and this style will disappear. 
A common denominator among these type of movies, is that it's always the veteran actors are involved in it. 
Why are we accepting this crap? 
quick money hack if done right. 
--This is the code.--

> [!NOTE]
> It's like a startup, get the call sheet of a big actor, recycle old torchbearer script, u don't even need a producer with money, can finance the money by mortgaging the callsheet of big names, split work between different depts, sell the movie to Red Giant, 3 days collection, name and fame.
