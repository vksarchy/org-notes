[[Story Telling]]

Okay, I can help with that! Here's a summary of the video and an action plan for you to improve your storytelling:

**Summary:**

The video focuses on how to make your stories more engaging by "zooming into the moment" rather than just summarizing events. It provides five techniques to achieve this:

1.  **Location:** State where you are physically to help the audience visualize the scene.
2.  **Actions:** Describe what you are doing in that specific moment to create forward momentum.
3.  **Thoughts:** Share your raw, unfiltered thoughts from that moment to make the story relatable.
4.  **Emotions:** Show the emotion through physical expressions rather than just stating how you felt.
5.  **Dialogue:** Use direct quotes from the characters involved to make the story more interesting.

The video uses an example story by Sarah Willingham to illustrate these techniques in action.

## Action Plan to Improve Your Storytelling

Here's a plan for you to implement these techniques and become a more captivating storyteller:

6.  **Practice Identifying the Five Elements:**

    *   Watch the Sarah Willingham story again (from 7:19 in the video).
    *   Specifically note where she uses:
        *   Location
        *   Action
        *   Thoughts
        *   Emotions
        *   Dialogue
    *   Try to find these elements in other stories you hear or read.

7.  **Record and Analyze Your Own Stories:**

    *   Record yourself telling a story. It could be about your day, a work experience, or anything else.
    *   Transcribe the story.
    *   Analyze the transcription.
    *   Identify areas where you summarized instead of "zooming in."
    *   Look for opportunities to add the five elements: location, action, thoughts, emotions, and dialogue.

8.  **Rewrite and Re-Record:**

    *   Rewrite your story, incorporating the five techniques.
    *   Focus on showing rather than telling.
    *   Re-record yourself telling the revised story.
    *   Compare the two recordings. You should notice a significant difference in engagement.

9.  **Focus on One Technique at a Time:**

    *   Don't try to master all five techniques at once.
    *   Pick one technique to focus on each week.
    *   For example, in week one, concentrate on adding more vivid descriptions of *actions* to your stories.
    *   In week two, work on incorporating more authentic *thoughts*.
    *   Continue this process until you feel comfortable using all five techniques.

10.  **Seek Feedback:**

    *   Share your stories with trusted friends or colleagues.
    *   Ask for specific feedback on how engaging the story was and whether the five elements were effectively used.
    *   In Chennai, consider joining a Toastmasters club or a similar public speaking group to get regular feedback and practice.

11.  **Be Mindful in Conversations:**

    *   In your daily conversations, be conscious of how you're telling stories.
    *   Actively try to incorporate the techniques you're learning.
    *   Pay attention to how people react to your stories.
    *   Adjust your approach based on their responses.

12.  **Keep a Storytelling Journal:**

    *   Note down interesting events or anecdotes that happen to you or that you witness.
    *   Jot down details about the location, actions, thoughts, and emotions associated with these events.
    *   This will serve as a valuable resource when you need to tell a story.

By consistently applying these steps, you'll develop your storytelling skills and become a more impactful and engaging communicator. Good luck!
