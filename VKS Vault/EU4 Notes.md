## **1. Trade Protection CB — What it is**

In **Europa Universalis IV**, **Trade Protection** is a **Casus Belli (CB)** that allows you to **declare war to protect your trade interests** in a trade node.

### **When you get it**

You gain this CB when:

* Another country is **using privateers** to steal trade power in a node where you have significant trade interest.
* Their privateering hurts your trade income.

### **War Objectives**

### Up 

### Down


* **Show Superiority** (win more battles than they do).
* Destroy their fleets to stop privateering.

### **War Goal**

* **Blockade ports** and win naval battles.
  (Winning naval dominance scores warscore fast.)

### **Possible Results**

| Peace Term              | Effect                                   |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Stop Privateering       | Forces enemy to stop piracy in that node |
| Transfer Trade Power    | You gain their trade power               |
| War Reparations / Money | Profit                                   |
| Humiliate               | Power projection boost                   |

**Use like Toranaga:**
Strike their economy, break their fleet, starve their treasury — war without marching an army.

> **Mantra:** *Control trade. Control wealth. Wealth buys victory.*

## **2. “Countries Wishing to Hire Condottieri” — Explanation**

Condottieri = **renting out your troops for money**, without entering the war officially.

### **What the UI Means**

When you see:

> *Countries wish to hire Condottieri*

It means:

* Some nations are at war and need additional troops.
* They are **willing to pay you** to rent your army.

### **Benefits**

| Advantage                             | Tactical Purpose                 |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Earn gold                             | Fund wars & economy              |
| Gain army tradition & professionalism | Without declaring war            |
| Improve relations                     | Become useful ally               |
| Fight indirectly                      | Toranaga style: victory by proxy |

### **Rules**

* You must **not** be at war.
* They pay **monthly** based on troop size.
* You can secretly fight alongside them.

**Small print cunning:**
If your Condottieri **fight against your rival**, you gain **power projection** without diplomatic penalty.

> **Mantra:** *Let others bleed while you profit.*

## **Strategic Toranaga-Style Combo**

| Move                                                  | Outcome                            |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Rent Condottieri to a nation fighting your enemy      | Hurt your enemy indirectly         |
| Use their distraction to declare Trade Protection war | Break their economy simultaneously |
| While fleets fight, your rented army wins battles     | Double pressure, minimal risk      |

**Outcome:**
*You become kingmaker while appearing neutral — classic cunning.*
