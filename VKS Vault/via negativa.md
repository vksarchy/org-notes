The **via negativa** (Latin for "negative way") is a philosophical and theological approach that seeks to understand something by describing what it is _not_ rather than what it _is_. This method is often used to address abstract or transcendent concepts that are difficult to define directly.

### Key Features of Via Negativa:

1. **Descriptive Negation**: Instead of stating positive attributes, it focuses on eliminating misconceptions or boundaries.  
    Example: To describe God, via negativa might assert that God is "not finite," "not bound by time," or "not comprehensible by human reason."
    
2. **Avoidance of Limitation**: By avoiding positive statements, it prevents the limitation of a concept, especially one believed to be infinite or ineffable.
    
3. **Rooted in Mysticism**: Common in mysticism and apophatic theology (e.g., Christian, Islamic, and Jewish traditions), where it is believed that the divine is beyond human comprehension.
