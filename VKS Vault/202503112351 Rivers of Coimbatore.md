Coimbatore is surrounded by several significant rivers and water bodies, playing crucial roles in its ecosystem and water supply. Here are the key rivers and water bodies, along with the main water sources for the city:

## Rivers and Water Bodies in Coimbatore

- **Noyyal River**: A tributary of the Kaveri River, it originates from the Western Ghats and flows through Coimbatore. Although it is known for its capricious nature and is often dry due to pollution and urbanization, it historically played a significant role in the city's water supply and irrigation[2](https://www.coimbatorecity.com/lakes-wetlands-in-coimbatore-city/)[7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coimbatore).
    
- **Siruvani River**: A tributary of the Bhavani River, it is a crucial source of drinking water for Coimbatore. The Siruvani water supply scheme was initiated in 1932, and it continues to be a vital source of water for the city[4](https://mainstreamweekly.net/article7856.html).
    
- **Bhavani River**: Originating in the Nilgiri district of Tamil Nadu, it flows through Kerala before returning to Tamil Nadu. The Bhavani River is another significant source of water for Coimbatore, contributing to both drinking water and irrigation[4](https://mainstreamweekly.net/article7856.html).
    
- **Lakes and Tanks**: Coimbatore has an extensive system of lakes and tanks, often referred to as "System Tanks" by the Public Works Department (PWD). These include Singanallur Lake, Kuruchi Lake, Valankulam Lake, and many others, totaling 24 lakes in the Noyyal River Basin[2](https://www.coimbatorecity.com/lakes-wetlands-in-coimbatore-city/).
    

## Main Water Supplying Rivers

At present, the main water sources for Coimbatore are:

- **Siruvani River**: Supplies drinking water to the city through the Siruvani water supply scheme[4](https://mainstreamweekly.net/article7856.html).
    
- **Bhavani River**: Contributes significantly to both drinking water and irrigation needs. The Pillur reservoir, which receives water from the Bhavani River, is a major source of water for Coimbatore[6](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/coimbatore-corporation-commissioner-rules-out-water-shortage-this-summer/articleshow/118338563.cms).
    

These rivers, along with the newly inaugurated water treatment plants like the 178.3 MLD WTP, ensure a reliable water supply to the city[5](https://www.wabag.com/news-event/coimbatores-water-supply-gets-a-boost-wabag-built-178-3-mld-water-treatment-plant-inaugurated/)
