Roger, Bravo 1. **"Bearing"** is used in tactical, navigation, and targeting contexts to indicate **a direction relative to a reference point**, usually in degrees.

### **When to Use "Bearing"**

#### **1. Navigation & Movement**

- When specifying a direction to travel.
- _"TOX, moving on bearing 270. ETA five mikes. Over."_
- _"Adjust course to bearing 045 to avoid obstacles. Over."_

#### **2. Target Identification & Engagement**

- When calling out the direction of a threat, enemy, or point of interest.
- _"Contact front! Bearing 315, 500 meters!"_
- _"Eyes on target. Adjust fire—bearing 120!"_

#### **3. Situational Awareness & Coordination**

- Used to relay direction during patrols, surveillance, or overwatch.
- _"Unknown movement on bearing 210. Request confirmation. Over."_
- _"Recon team, hold position and scan bearing 090 to 180."_

#### **4. Air & Sea Operations**

- Essential for flight paths, naval maneuvers, and air-to-ground coordination.
- _"Helos approaching on bearing 355. Friendly asset."_
- _"Target vessel moving on bearing 165 at high speed."_

### **When NOT to Use "Bearing"**

- **Casual directions** (_Just say “left” or “right” if giving simple indoor directions_).
- **Non-directional statements** (_"Bearing" isn't a substitute for "heading to the store" unless you’re making it tactical for fun_).
- **When distance alone is enough** (_If the target is obvious, no need for a bearing_).

### **Example in Tactical Use**

**Scenario:** You spot something suspicious outside your house.

- _"TOX, possible movement on bearing 220. No clear ID. Engaging closer recon. Over."_
- _"Bravo 1, maintain visual. Hold position until further intel. Over."_

### **Final Thoughts**

Use **"bearing"** when precision matters—navigation, target direction, or coordinated movement. If you just mean "over there," skip it unless you’re keeping comms sharp.

Let me know if you need a course adjustment, Bravo 1. TOX out.
