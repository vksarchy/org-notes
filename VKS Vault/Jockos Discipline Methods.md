Affirmative, Bravo 1.  
**Executing Option B and Option C responses now—military tone, direct, tactical.**  
(Discipline per Jocko + behavioural science + framework + drills + mantras)

# **Option B — Behavioural Science + Jocko Perspective**

### **Why Discipline Matters (Short & Surgical)**

Discipline is not motivation.  
Motivation is a feeling. **Discipline is action despite feelings.**  
The brain seeks comfort; discipline rewires it by repeated controlled discomfort.

### **Core Principles (Jocko Style)**

- **Ownership** — No excuses. You are responsible. Full stop.
    
- **Execute** — Don’t wait. Do it now.
    
- **Routine** — Systems beat inspiration.
    
- **Simplicity** — Reduce decision clutter.
    
- **Consistency > Intensity**

## **Structured System**

### **Morning**

- Wake up at a fixed time (no negotiation)
    
- Make bed (proof of control)
    
- 10 minutes movement (push-ups, walk, stretch)
    
- Plan day in 3 priorities only
    

### **Midday**

- Check progress against plan
    
- Correct deviations without guilt
    
- 5-minute reset: breathe, recalibrate, continue
    

### **Night**

- Review wins + failures
    
- Prepare gear for next day
    
- Sleep discipline (cut screens 45 minutes prior)

## **Discipline Code (10 words or less)**

**“Do it now. No excuses. Consistency is freedom.”**

---

## **Mantra Lines**

- **Discipline equals freedom.**
    
- **I don’t negotiate with weakness.**
    
- **Comfort is the enemy.**
    
- **Execute. Execute. Execute.**
    
- **Win the morning. Win the day.**

# **Option C — Problem → Method → Drills**

## **The Principle**

**Discipline is choosing purpose over impulse.**  
Feelings don’t get a vote.

---

## **Framework**

|Stage|Focus|Question|
|---|---|---|
|**Awareness**|Identify weakness|Where do I break?|
|**Control**|Reduce choices|What can I automate?|
|**Action**|Execute small wins|What’s step 1 now?|
|**Repetition**|Daily drill|Did I show up today?|

---

## **Reality Check**

Discipline hurts.  
That’s the point.  
If it doesn’t hurt, it’s maintenance—not growth.

---

## **7-Day Discipline Training Protocol**

**Day 1** — Set wake-up time. Stick to it.  
**Day 2** — Set 3 goals. Complete all 3.  
**Day 3** — Do 20 minutes physical training.  
**Day 4** — Cut one comfort (sugar, phone, gossip, Netflix).  
**Day 5** — Review day mercilessly. Record failures.  
**Day 6** — Execute something difficult immediately.  
**Day 7** — Silent reflection: plan next week.

Repeat until your identity changes.

## **Drills**

- **Immediate Action Drill:** Count 3-2-1 and move.
    
- **No-Option Drill:** Remove alternatives.
    
- **Cold Exposure:** 60 seconds cold shower daily.
    
- **Unbroken Chain:** Mark calendar. Never miss twice.

## **Mantra Lines (Short, Punchy, Military)**

- **“You don’t need motivation. You need orders.”**
    
- **“Feelings are lies.”**
    
- **“Discipline is destiny.”**
    
- **“You stop when you’re done.”**
    
- **“Stand up. Move. Now.”**
