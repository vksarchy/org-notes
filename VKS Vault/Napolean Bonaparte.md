> 🧠 **BRAIN MODE:**  
> Napoleon’s meteoric rise was fueled by both his military genius and the political chaos of Revolutionary France. His ability to inspire troops, innovate on the battlefield, and centralize power made him a transformative figure. Yet, his overreach—especially in Spain and Russia—led to his downfall. Even in exile, his legend grew, influencing subsequent generations of leaders and revolutionaries. His legal and administrative reforms endure, while his ambition and charisma remain archetypal in studies of leadership and power.
