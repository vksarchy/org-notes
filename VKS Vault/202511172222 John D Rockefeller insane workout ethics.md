    - Described as having a “hide like a rhinoceros”; “control of self wins the battle for it means control of others.”youtube​
        
3. **Fear of Wasting Time / Aversion to Laziness**
    
    - Rockefeller disliked slothfulness, considering laziness almost a sin and deeply opposed to his purpose.youtube​
        
    - Believed “hard work builds character,” and never wanted to waste time or fall short of his potential.youtube​
        
    - Advocated journaling your dream life and its opposite, then writing daily habits to bridge the gap.youtube​
        
4. **Long Walks**
    
    - Took long walks daily, often with business partner Henry Flagler, using this time for thinking, planning, and strategizing.youtube​
        
    - Inspired similar habits in other great figures like Steve Jobs, Tesla, Einstein, Franklin, and Ford.youtube​
        
    - Walks increase creativity and provide mental space for new ideas.youtube​

    - Understood good sleep’s impact on longevity, health, and focus, consistent with advice from books like "Why We Sleep" by Matthew Walker.youtube​
        
    - Referenced Benjamin Franklin’s maxim: “Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.”.youtube​
        
6. **Consistency**
    
    - Lived a simple, habitual, and consistent life—dressed the same, ate the same food, and followed the same daily routines.youtube​
        
    - Believed empires are built not in days but in decades—continued habits from apprentice days to wealthy adulthood.youtube​
        
    - Quoted: “I carried a lunch in my pocket until I was a rich man. I trained myself in the school of self-control and self-denial.”.youtube​
        
    - Saw habits as compounding over time—the “interest” from persistent habits far outweighs short-lived efforts.youtube​
