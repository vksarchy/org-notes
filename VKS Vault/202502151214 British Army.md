Corps: The size of a corps varies greatly, but two to five divisions and anywhere from 40,000 to 80,000 are the numbers stated by the US Department of Defense.

The British Army has a well-defined rank structure that is divided into two main categories: Other Ranks (ORs) and Officers. This hierarchy ensures a clear chain of command and defines responsibilities within the military. Let's break down these categories and explain the ranks in each:

## Other Ranks (ORs)

Other Ranks form the backbone of the British Army and include:

### Junior Ranks

1. **Private**: The entry-level rank for soldiers. They are responsible for executing orders and maintaining discipline[7].

2. **Lance Corporal**: The first step in leadership, commanding small teams[3].

3. **Corporal**: Commands sections of about 8-10 soldiers or a single tank[3].

### Senior Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs)

4. **Sergeant**: Second in command of a troop or platoon of around 30 soldiers[3].

5. **Staff Sergeant** (or **Colour Sergeant** in some regiments): Manages a company, battery, or squadron[3].

### Warrant Officers

6. **Warrant Officer Class 2 (WO2)**: Often serves as Company Sergeant Major[3].

7. **Warrant Officer Class 1 (WO1)**: The most senior soldier rank, often serving as Regimental Sergeant Major[3].

## Officers

Officers are responsible for leadership and strategy:

### Junior Officers

8. **Officer Cadet**: Rank held during initial officer training[5].

9. **Second Lieutenant**: The most junior officer rank, typically leading a platoon[5].

10. **Lieutenant**: Commands a platoon or troop of around 30 soldiers[1].

11. **Captain**: Usually second-in-command of a company of up to 120 soldiers[1].

### Field Officers

12. **Major**: Typically commands a sub-unit of around 120 soldiers[1].

13. **Lieutenant Colonel**: Commands a battalion or regiment of up to 650 soldiers[1].

14. **Colonel**: Serves as a staff officer or senior adviser[1].

### General Officers

15. **Brigadier**: Commands a brigade or serves as a director of staff[1].

16. **Major General**: Commands a division[5].

17. **Lieutenant General**: Commands a corps[5].

18. **General**: The most senior rank, responsible for the entire Army[5].

19. **Field Marshal**: Currently an honorary rank[5].

## Hierarchy and Promotion

The rank structure follows a clear hierarchy, with each rank having specific responsibilities and command sizes. Promotion is typically based on merit, experience, and time served. For example, a Private might be promoted to Lance Corporal after about 3 years of service[3].

Officers generally start as Second Lieutenants after completing officer training and can progress through the ranks based on their performance and leadership abilities[5].

This structured system ensures that the British Army operates efficiently, with clear lines of authority and a well-defined path for career progression.
