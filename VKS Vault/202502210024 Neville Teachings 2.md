**1. Study the Law.** Read Neville, read other important authors who influenced Neville, until you achieve an intellectual conviction that the Law is real. What is an intellectual conviction? If you tell me there’s a planet in the universe, although I cannot see and verify with my own eyes, I can still accept it exists because through study and learning I come to understand how the universe is structured, distances involved, etc. So first step is gaining a _thorough_ intellectual acceptance that the Law is real.

**2. Practice the Law.** Now you know the Law is real but you wonder if YOU can apply it and make it work. Having covered the theory, now you add personal experience. Start with manifesting projects you don’t care much about. Most people here try to “get their SP” or make millions. This is like trying to solve third-degree equations in the second grade elementary school. So start with basic things and move gradually and patiently to more complex projects. Neville said "If there's one thing you need, is patience".

**3. Remove subconscious conditioning.** Subconscious beliefs are limiting factors. What Neville meant with the biblical expression “dropping the seed” is impressing your subconscious mind with an idea produced in the laboratory of your objective mind. The impression will fail if the subconscious mind is conditioned. If you want to manifest a great career, but subconsciously you suffer from the impostor syndrome, that needs to be removed first. How to remove it would require a separate discussion. It can be done through therapy, meditation, spiritual realignment (_metanoia_) or a combination of these.

**4. Remove the importance placed on externals.** The exaggerated importance placed on goals is what Indian metaphysics calls “attachment” and it’s what modern occultists call “the law of excess potential” and on a more popular level is known as “putting things on a pedestal.” The moment you condition your happiness to something on the outside, fear becomes inevitable and fear makes doubt inevitable and doubt blocks the attempt to impress your subconscious with a desired belief. You cannot condition your inner peace on anything or anybody outside of yourself. That’s why Neville said “If you believe fulfillment is conditioned on a chain letter, another person, or going to church and praying to an unknown God, then something has come between you and the one foundation.”

**5. Impress new beliefs.** With a firm acceptance of the Law, both in theory and practice, and with a clear subconscious you are now ready to reprogram yourself by impressing your desired beliefs on your subconscious mind. Depending on how well you removed your subconscious conditionings, the conversion of wishes into beliefs and then into subconscious convictions can be done with a single imaginal act or with a series of repetitions. Depending on the nature of your external mind, your subconscious may be more susceptible to images, or words, or other vehicles for transferring ideas.

**6. Allow the process to take place**. Fixed subconscious convictions generate circumstances aligned with those convictions. Neville called it the Bridge of Incidents. Some events will take place and some may not appear to indicate progress, yet your knowledge of the Law will keep you calm and reassured, because you know that the outcome is never in question. Just go with the flow and let things take their course because a mere wish may end in disappointment, but a true conviction never goes unfulfilled. You can write that sentence on your bathroom mirror: **a mere wish may end in disappointment, but a true conviction never goes unfulfilled.**

This is the manifesting process, learning & application, in a nutshell. None of these steps can be skipped if you intend to rely on the Law and make it a lifestyle. If you want to manifest free donuts, you can probably go directly to step 5 because there’s likely no subconscious conditioning to prevent it and your happiness doesn’t depend on those donuts either. If you want something important to you, something you never had or something that’s brutally denied by objective facts, you have almost no chance of succeeding unless you make this a complete journey as described above. This is neither fast nor easy, but after years of doing this, I will tell you it’s totally worth it.

> Can I actually now, this very moment, construct a simple conversation, which, if it is true, will involve that I realize my objective? Can I then be faithful to that conversation, or will I wander from it? Well, I’m telling you, it’s very difficult – It seems so simple. I certainly could take a little conversation between a friend and myself in a dialogue and tell him that all things are as I would like them to be, that I have this goal and that goal, and ‘Do you know, I have realized it? It all came so simply and so naturally; it all fell into place.’ Could you really believe that? (‘Order Your Conversations Aright,’ n.d.).

P.S. To clarify, because some of you guys assume that the above takes years. All the steps I indicated above can be accomplished in a matter of months. The study once accomplished does not need to be repeated. All the other phases depend strictly on your mind. It can take hours, days or weeks to re-program subconscious beliefs. The bridge of Incidents is of course out of our hands completely because it has "its appointed time.
