"Do not skyline" is a tactical directive advising personnel to avoid silhouetting themselves against the horizon. This happens when someone moves along a ridgeline or hilltop, making them an easy target due to their contrast against the sky.

To avoid skylining:

- Stay below the crest of hills or ridges.
- Use defilade and terrain masking.
- Move along the military crest (the highest point where you can see without exposing yourself).

In short: Stay low, stay hidden, stay alive.
