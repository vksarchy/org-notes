[[Talking trash]]

---

Trash talk is an art—it's about getting under someone's skin without losing your cool. A good trash talker knows what to pick out, how to deliver it, and when to walk away with a win. Here’s your guide:

### **1. Pick the Right Target**

- **Appearance:** Subtle, not obvious. If they’re wearing ridiculous shoes, call them “the most confident man alive.”
- **Performance:** Highlight their mistakes. “That was a bold strategy… missing every shot.”
- **Ego:** Use sarcasm. “Wow, I didn’t know you were _this_ talented.”

### **2. Use Their Words Against Them**

- If they brag about something, twist it. “Oh, you bench 300? Guess you left all your strength at the door.”
- If they make an excuse, flip it. “Oh, the sun was in your eyes? I didn’t know it was only shining on you.”

### **3. Stay Cool and Unbothered**

- Never raise your voice. The calmer you are, the more frustrating it is for them.
- Smirk. Shake your head. Look at them like they just said the dumbest thing you’ve ever heard.

### **4. Be Witty, Not Crude**

- Swearing is cheap. Be creative. “I’d agree with you, but then we’d both be wrong.”
- Obscure insults hit harder. “You play like a training dummy that forgot it was training.”

### **5. When to Walk Away**

- If they’re getting flustered, you won. No need to keep going.
- If they start repeating themselves, you’ve broken them.
