Getting obsessed with something when you're just starting out can be a powerful way to stay motivated and make rapid progress. It’s about cultivating a sense of excitement, curiosity, and dedication. Here’s how you can develop that kind of obsession:

### 1. **Immerse Yourself Fully**
   - **Go Deep, Not Wide:** Instead of trying to dip your toes into many things, focus deeply on one. This creates a sense of immersion. The more time you dedicate, the more you’ll start to uncover nuances that keep you intrigued.
   - **Surround Yourself with It:** Create an environment that reflects your new passion—follow related blogs, podcasts, and social media accounts. The more you're exposed to it, the more it becomes a part of your life.

### 2. **Start with Curiosity**
   - **Ask Questions:** The more you start to ask questions about the subject, the more you'll naturally become fascinated by the complexity. Curious people often find themselves diving deeper and deeper into a topic.
   - **Find the "Why":** Understand why the thing you're interested in matters. What’s its significance in the larger picture? Knowing the value can create a stronger emotional investment.

### 3. **Make It a Habit**
   - **Practice Consistently:** Obsession often comes from continuous engagement. Even if you’re a beginner, try to do something related to it every day, even if it’s just for 15 minutes. Repetition builds familiarity and increases interest.
   - **Set Small Milestones:** Set little goals, and as you achieve them, celebrate. Each small success can fuel further passion and momentum.

### 4. **Engage with the Community**
   - **Find Like-Minded People:** Join forums, attend meetups, or interact with others who are equally passionate. Their enthusiasm can become contagious, and the sense of belonging can deepen your own obsession.
   - **Learn from Experts:** Follow those who have mastered the craft or topic. Learning from the best can inspire you and give you insight into the path they took.

### 5. **Embrace the Challenge**
   - **Push Through Frustration:** It’s easy to lose interest when you encounter difficulties, but overcoming challenges deepens your relationship with whatever you're learning. When you push past roadblocks, you’ll often experience a greater sense of accomplishment.
   - **See Failures as Part of the Process:** Mistakes can be the most fascinating part of learning, and they provide valuable lessons. When you understand that failure is just part of growth, you’ll start to lean into the process.

### 6. **Enjoy the Journey**
   - **Fall in Love with Progress, Not Perfection:** Instead of obsessing over an end goal, focus on the joy of getting better. The growth and the discovery are often more rewarding than the outcome itself.
   - **Celebrate Small Wins:** Every time you understand something new or improve a little bit, recognize it. The feeling of achievement, no matter how small, can spark further obsession.

### 7. **Visualize the Impact**
   - **Imagine How It Will Change You:** When you see your obsession as a way to transform your life or contribute to something greater, it fuels an even deeper connection. Whether it's developing a skill or making an impact, knowing the potential outcomes keeps the fire burning.

### 8. **Allow Your Obsession to Evolve**
   - **Stay Open to New Discoveries:** As you get deeper into something, you’ll discover more aspects of it. The joy of learning more will keep you interested and allow your obsession to grow and evolve in unexpected ways.

Obsession isn’t about forcing yourself to love something; it’s about creating the conditions where interest and passion can grow. It happens when you let yourself get deeply involved, remain curious, and stick with it through both the highs and the lows.
