# Defining the problem 

Bravo 1, good on you for pausing and facing it squarely.  
Low moods are often just "unsolved signals" — they get bigger if ignored.  
Here’s your **clearance checklist** to define the _real_ problem:

---

### **Primary Targeting Questions:**

1. **What exactly am I feeling?**  
    (e.g., tired, frustrated, lonely, overwhelmed, bored, uncertain.)
    
2. **When did this feeling start?**  
    (Was it a sharp event? Or did it build up?)
    
3. **What triggered it?**  
    (Specific event? Interaction? News? Something missing?)
    
4. **What am I avoiding or postponing right now?**  
    (Low energy often masks fear of action.)
    
5. **If this feeling had a voice, what would it be saying?**  
    (E.g., "I'm lost," "I'm failing," "I'm tired of pretending.")
    

---

### **Secondary Recon (Environmental Check):**

6. **Is this about my body (physical)?**  
    (e.g., lack of sleep, poor food, no movement, sickness.)
    
7. **Is this about my mind (mental overload)?**  
    (e.g., decision fatigue, spinning thoughts, boredom.)
    
8. **Is this about my heart (emotions/relationships)?**  
    (e.g., feeling disconnected, misunderstood.)
    
9. **Is this about my mission (meaning/purpose)?**  
    (e.g., feeling adrift, lacking progress, unclear goals.)
    

---

### **Target Refinement:**

10. **What would a small win look like today?**  
    (Tiny victories often lift heavy moods fast.)
    
11. **Am I catastrophising (making things bigger than they are)?**  
    (Catch the mental movie before it runs wild.)
    
12. **What would I advise my best friend to do if they felt exactly like this?**  
    (Externalising clears fog.)

> **Key principle:**  
> You are not _inside_ the problem.  
> You are _outside_ observing the problem.

You already demonstrated strength by stepping back and _asking_ this instead of drowning in it.  
Most people don't even get that far.

Here’s a **problem-solving template** in a quick, tactical 3-box model. This one’s designed to clear your head, fast:

---

# 🧠 **Problem-Solving Template (Clearance Checklist)**

---

### 📡 **1. Signal**

> **What is the problem showing up as?**  
> (Emotion, situation, thought, physical feeling)  
> _Write down the _signal_ you’re receiving._

🖊️ _______________________________

---

### 🔍 **2. Cause**

> **Why is this happening? (Root cause, triggers, underlying factors)**  
> _Think about potential causes — it could be external (environment) or internal (thoughts/emotions)._

🖊️ _______________________________

---

### 🛠️ **3. Action**

> **What’s the smallest next step to solve or improve this?**  
> (Specific, tangible action you can take immediately.)  
> _This should be the "first move" toward solving it._

🖊️ _______________________________

---

## 📜 **Execution Plan**

- **Focus on Action**, not a “perfect solution” — quick progress is better than no progress.
    
- **Review in 1 day** — did the action move you toward solving the issue? If not, iterate and repeat.
    

---

### Example:

- **Signal**: "I’m feeling overwhelmed, I don’t know where to start today."
    
- **Cause**: "I haven’t set clear priorities for the day, and I’m stuck in decision paralysis."
    
- **Action**: "Take 5 minutes to write down 3 top tasks for today, no more. Start with the smallest one."
    


# How to solve it via storytelling 

Alright, Bravo 1 —  
If the mind _creates_ storms through bad stories, it can also _calm storms_ by writing better ones.  
Here’s how you _solve_ your internal problem using **storytelling**:

---

## **Simple Tactical Process:**

1. **Identify the current "bad story" running in your head.**  
    (E.g., "I’m stuck... I can’t fix this... I’m failing...")
    
2. **Interrupt it.**  
    ("That's _one_ version of the story — not _the_ story.")
    
3. **Rewrite the story as a _hero's journey_ — but real.**  
    Frame it as:
    
    - **Current struggle = Call to Adventure**
        
    - **Feeling lost = Fog of War before a breakthrough**
        
    - **Small action = First move toward regaining ground**
        
4. **Speak or write the new story aloud.**  
    (It matters. Silent stories die easily; spoken stories become missions.)
    

---

## **Example:**

**Situation**:  
You’re feeling low, heavy, unfocused.

**Current Bad Story (Silent)**:

> "I’m stuck. I don’t have the energy. I should be better than this."

**Interrupt and Acknowledge**:

> "That's one story — but it's _not the full mission report_."

**New Story (Spoken / Written)**:

> "I am a soldier in the middle of a fogged-out battlefield. Visibility is low, but my compass is still working.  
> Right now, my mission isn't to win the whole war — it's to find high ground for better vision.  
> The low mood is the smoke of recent battles, not defeat.  
> My next move is simple: secure a small win — eat something good, walk outside for 5 minutes, reset my stance."

---

**Key difference**:  
The bad story said "You’re defeated."  
The good story says "You’re _moving_ in fog."

**Fog = natural.  
Frozen = optional.**

---

## **Summary Formula:**

| Step                    | Action                                       |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Detect bad story        | Write/speak the script running silently      |
| Interrupt it            | Declare: "That's _one version_, not _truth_" |
| Rewrite it as a journey | Struggle → Fog → Small Victory → Progress    |
| Take micro-action       | Anchor the new story in reality              |

# Kaizen Way approach 

Bravo 1 — solid move.  
Kaizen is _small, relentless, intelligent change_. It’s not "fix it all today." It’s "improve by 1% daily — and never stop."

To **implement Kaizen-style questioning and action**, here’s your operational manual:

---

## 1. **Kaizen Mindset First**

🔹 **Assume**:

> "There is always a small improvement hiding here."

🔹 **Commit**:

> "No blaming, no freezing — just small fixes, daily."

---

## 2. **Kaizen Question Framework**

Every time you feel stuck, low, or see an opportunity:

|Level|Question|Example|
|---|---|---|
|Detect|"What is one thing that feels off?"|"I feel mentally heavy after lunch."|
|Understand|"Why does this happen (root cause)?"|"Eating too heavy, not moving after."|
|Imagine|"What is a tiny tweak I could try?"|"5 min walk post-lunch."|
|Test|"How can I try it today, easily?"|"Put shoes near my desk."|
|Reflect|"Did it help? What’s next tweak?"|"Energy rose 20%. Try a 10-min walk next."|

---

_(Notice: No massive overhauls. Tiny, smart pressure on the system.)_

---

## 3. **Kaizen Action Loop ("The Circle of Tiny Wins")**

Simple daily procedure:

1. **Observe** (small friction points in your day).
    
2. **Ask** (Kaizen question).
    
3. **Tweak** (test a micro-change immediately).
    
4. **Log** (record even tiny wins — builds visible momentum).
    
5. **Refine** (adjust and re-apply tomorrow).
    

**🔄 Loop daily, weaponising momentum.**

---

## 4. **Real Example: Mood Low Situation**

Let’s Kaizen your current low-energy case:

- **Detect**: "Feeling low and muddy in the head."
    
- **Understand**: "Possibly no clear action plan, mental overload."
    
- **Imagine**: "What’s a micro-tweak? Write 3 next steps only."
    
- **Test**: "Right now, in the next 5 minutes, no overthinking."
    
- **Reflect**: "Did making 3 steps sharpen my mind? (Probably yes.)"
    

**Outcome**:  
The problem isn’t your energy. It’s your system needing a 1% sharper edge.

---

## 5. **Kaizen Tactical Tools**

|Tool|Purpose|
|---|---|
|Daily 1% Improvement Log|Track tiny tweaks, build compounding progress.|
|“What’s 1% better?” Habit|Instantly counter perfectionism and paralysis.|
|Morning Tactical Briefing (3 Qs)|Every morning: “What’s the biggest friction?” → “How do I sand it down 1%?” → “What’s the smallest next step?”|

---

## Quick Battle Reminder:

> **Small moves, done daily, will outflank gigantic plans abandoned halfway.**

Kaizen isn't sexy.  
It's lethal.
