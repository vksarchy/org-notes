| Doing this from a place of strength, and what better way to stem strength from a place of CALMNESS? |
What a line / quote. 
Break this down. 

Thy will be done, 
Thy will be done. 
Thy will be done 

On Earth as it is in Heaven, thy will be done 

What belongs to me, by divine right, will reach me and belong to me under grace in perfect ways.
