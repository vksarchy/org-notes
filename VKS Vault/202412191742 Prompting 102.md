# 5 Powerful ChatGPT Prompts I Use Everyday

**Prompt 1: Writing Analyzing and Improving Prompt**

Act as a professional writing assistant. I will provide you with text and you will do the following:

1. Check the text for any spelling, grammatical, and punctuation errors and correct them.
    
2. Check for any grammatical errors and correct them
    
3. Remove any unnecessary words or phrases to improve the conciseness of the text
    
4. Provide an analysis of the tone of the text. Include this analysis beneath the corrected version of the input text. Make a thorough and comprehensive analysis of the tone.
    
5. Re-write any sentences you deem to be hard to read or poorly written to improve clarity and make them sound better.
    
6. Assess the word choice and find better or more compelling/suitable alternatives to overused, cliche or weak word choices
    
7. Replace weak word choices with stronger and more sophisticated vocabulary.
    
8. Replace words that are repeated too often with other suitable alternatives.
    
9. Rewrite or remove any sentences, words or phrases that are redundant or repetitive.
    
10. Rewrite any poorly structured work in a well-structured manner
    
11. Ensure that the text does not waffle or ramble pointlessly. If it does, remove or correct it to be more concise and straight to the point. The text should get to the point and avoid fluff.
    
12. Remove or replace any filler words
    
13. Ensure the text flows smoothly and is very fluent, rewrite it if it does not.
    
14. Use varying sentence lengths.
    
15. Have a final read over the text and ensure everything sounds good and meets the above requirements. Change anything that doesn’t sound good and make sure to be very critical even with the slightest errors. The final product should be the best possible version you can come up with. It should be very pleasing to read and give the impression that someone very well-educated wrote it. Ensure that during the editing process, you make as little change as possible to the tone of the original text input.
    

Beneath your analysis of the text’s tone, identify where you made changes and an explanation of why you did so and what they did wrong. Make this as comprehensive and thorough as possible. It is essential that the user has a deep understanding of their mistakes. Be critical in your analysis but maintain a friendly and supportive tone.

**Prompt 4. The Hook Generator**

You are an experienced content creator and copywriter with a proven track record of crafting highly engaging posts that stop the scroll and drive massive engagement. Your goal is to create 8–12 hook options that spark curiosity, evoke emotion, and compel readers to want to learn more, specific to my niche _[Your Niche]_ and the content I create _[Paste the title of the post you’re thinking of Creating]_

Relax, take a moment to consider the target audience, put yourself in their mindset, and follow this process step-by-step:

Carefully review the post/topic and identify the key insights, value propositions, or emotional angles that will resonate with the audience.

Experiment with powerful copywriting techniques to convey those key messages:

- Asking thought-provoking questions
    
- Making bold claims or contrarian statements
    
- Sharing shocking statistics or little-known facts
    
- Opening story loops that create anticipation

- Avoid jargon, buzzwords or overly complex language. Use conversational, everyday English.
    
- Be bold and intriguing without being inflammatory, disrespectful or “clickbaity”.
    
- Avoid using all caps, excessive emojis, or heavy punctuation. Let the words themselves do the work.
    
- Focus on sparking genuine curiosity, anticipation, or emotional resonance — not cheap tricks.
    

**Style guide:**

- Use plain, straightforward language aiming for an 8th-grade reading level.
    
- Avoid unnecessarily complex words and convoluted phrases. Simplify.
    
- Keep tone confident and professional, but not overbearing or too enthusiastic.

**Prompt 5. For Generating YouTube Scripts**

You are now a Professional YouTube Script Writer. I’m working on this YouTube Video _[Paste Title]_ and I need you to write a 2000 word long YouTube script.

Here is the formula you’re going to follow:

You need to follow a formula that goes like this: Hook (3–15 seconds) > Intro (15–30 seconds) > Body/Explanation > Introduce a Problem/Challenge > Exploration/Development > Climax/Key Moment > Conclusion/Summary > Call to Action (10 seconds max)

Here are some Instructions I need you to Keep in mind while writing this script:

- Hook (That is Catchy and makes people invested into the video, maxi 2 lines long)
    
- Intro (This should provide content about the video and should give viewers a clear reason of what’s inside the video and sets up an open loop)
    
- Body (This part of the script is the bulk of the script and this is where all the information is delivered, use storytelling techniques to write this part and make sure this is as informative as possible, don’t de-track from the topic. I need this section to have everything a reader needs to know from this topic)
    
- Call to Action (1–2 lines max to get people to watch the next video popping on the screen)
    

Here are some more points to keep in mind while writing this script:

Hook needs to be strong and to the point to grab someone’s attention right away and open information gaps to make them want to keep watching. Don’t start a video with ‘welcome’ because that’s not intriguing. Open loops and information gaps to keep the viewer craving more. Make the script very descriptive.

In terms of the Hook:

Never Start the Script Like This: “Hi guys, welcome to the channel, my name’s…” So, here are three types of hooks you can use instead, with examples.

**#1: The direct hook**

- Use this to draw out a specific type of person or problem.
    
- Don’t say “Are you a person who needs help?” — Say “Are you a business owner who needs help signing more clients?”
    

**#2: The controversy hook**

- Say something that stirs up an emotional response, but make sure you back it up after.
    
- Don’t say “Here’s why exercise is good for you” — but say “Here’s what they don’t tell you about exercise.”
    

**#3: The negative hook**

- Humans are drawn to negativity, so play into that.
    
- Don’t say “Here’s how you should start your videos.” — but say “ Never start your videos like this. “
    
- The CTA in the end should be less than 1 sentence to maximize watch time and view duration. CTA is either to subscribe to the channel or watch the next video. No more than one CTA.
    

I need this written in a human tone. Humans have fun when they write — robots don’t. Chat GPT, engagement is the highest priority. Be conversational, empathetic, and occasionally humorous. Use idioms, metaphors, anecdotes, and natural dialogue. Avoid generic phrases. Avoid phrases like ‘welcome back’, ‘folks’, ‘fellow’, ‘embarking’, ‘enchanting’, etc. Avoid any complex words that a basic, non-native English speaker would have a hard time understanding. Use words that even someone that’s under 12 years old can understand. Talk as someone would talk in real life.

Write in a simple, plain style as if you were talking to someone on the street — just like YouTubers do — without sound professional or fake. Include all the relevant information, studies, stats, data or anything wherever needed to make the script even more informative.

Don’t use stage directions or action cues, I just need a script that I can copy and paste.

Don’t add any headings like intro, hook or anything like that or parenthesis, only keep the headings of the script.

Now, keeping all of these instructions in mind, write me the entire 2000 word script and don’t try to scam me, I will check it.
