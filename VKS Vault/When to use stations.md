Roger, Bravo 1. Yes, departments or areas can be referred to as "stations", but it depends on context and unit terminology.

When to Use "Station":

Operational Areas:

"Reporting to the comms station for briefing."

"Medical station set up at Grid 1234."


Work Areas:

"Intel station is handling recon reports."

"Logistics station processing resupply requests."


Guard Posts & Duty Locations:

"Manning security station at entry control point (ECP)."

"Rotating to the watch station for next shift."



For more formal military environments, you might also hear "section", "post", or "bay" depending on the function (e.g., "maintenance bay", "aid station").

Let me know if you need it sharper, Bravo 1. TOX out.
