# The Phone Call
As usual, the phone call 📞  meeting with Mr. C went for more than an hour.
 The MoM and the things i learned. Solid conversations. 🙌

Spoke about the EV project he is working on, 
350 cr - 100 % equity of them
Fujairah govt sponsoring them 50% of the cash along with 50% equity stake in the company - through FIA. 

Fujairah is 80% a mountaineous area with the town ppl giving in for the solid state of gold and other assets like supporting them with Crushers and other mining purposes, which they then export it to Bangladesh. 

Later we spoke about A german lad who was legit looking for 500k BTC to purchase at the current market rate now. He is worth over 70B, sitting in the UK. He has not listed any of his wealth, sitting in the shadows like a true g. He is friends with the prince of Ghana, who has about 500 gold mines there. He is friends with the Royal family UK, they have a seperate air strip and they supply to Al Maktum too. He claims that half of the gold present in the UK storage belongs to him. 

Then we spoke about running an organization, an establishment and how tough it is to run it, rather we should not stop the deals, take it and re invest in the the establishment. 

Some of the verticals handled: 
1. Real Estate

	3. Like an infinite glitch - developing an app to plant the tree and tokenize it, monthly subscription plan for taking care of the tree and “ taking ownership of the carbon footprint” and selling it back. 
	4. There is a carbon credit startup in DIFC, who they have invested in.
