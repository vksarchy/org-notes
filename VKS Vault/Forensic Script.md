**Script Title:** *Silent Witness*  
**Genre:** Crime/Procedural Drama  
**Runtime:** 12 minutes  
**Language:** English (with optional subtitles for regional dialogues)  

---

### Opening Scene: Crime Scene Investigation  
*(EXT. URBAN ALLEYWAY - NIGHT)*  
**Forensic Expert Dr. Aanya Roy (30s)** arrives with a kit. Police tape cordons off a dimly lit alley. A **bloodstain** glows under UV light.  

**DR. ANYA ROY**  
(voiceover, journalistic tone)  
"Every crime scene tells a story. Our job is to listen."  

She photographs the scene, collects blood samples, and lifts a **partial fingerprint** from a discarded knife.  

**CUT TO:**  
*(INT. CFSL LAB - DAY)*  
Close-up of DNA analysis on a screen. A **match** flashes: "Vikram Seth (28), prior theft convictions."  

**TECHNICIAN**  
"DNA links Vikram, but the blood spatter suggests a left-handed attacker. His records show right-handed."  

---

### Act 2: The Discrepancy  
*(INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM)*  
**Inspector Rohan Mehta** confronts Vikram, who denies involvement.  

**INSPECTOR MEHTA**  
"You were here last night. The knife has your prints."  

**VIKRAM**  
(agitated)  
"I lost that knife weeks ago! Check the CCTV—I was at a clinic!"  

*(MONTAGE: Forensic checks)*  
- **Ballistic report** confirms the knife’s blade matches the victim’s wounds.  
- **CCTV footage** verifies Vikram’s alibi: he was at a hospital during the crime.  

**DR. ROY**  
(analyzing the knife)  
"Wait—the handle’s grip residue has **two distinct DNA profiles**. Vikram’s... and someone else’s."  

---

### Act 3: Unmasking the Culprit  
*(EXT. MARKET - FLASHBACK)*  
The victim argues with a **shadowy figure** (left-handed). The figure grabs Vikram’s stolen knife.  

*(INT. CFSL LAB - NIGHT)*  
**Dr. Roy** runs a **diatom test** on the victim’s lungs, revealing freshwater diatoms from a local lake.  

**DR. ROY**  
(connecting dots)  
"The killer drowned him first. The stab was staged."  

**DATABASE SEARCH:** Matches the second DNA profile to **Rohit Malhotra**, a left-handed ex-con with a lakehouse.  

---

### Climax: Confrontation  
*(EXT. LAKEHOUSE - DAWN)*  
**Inspector Mehta** arrests Rohit. **Forensic team** finds the victim’s hair in Rohit’s boat.  

**ROHIT**  
(defeated)  
"He threatened to expose my smuggling. I had no choice..."  

---

### Closing Scene: Courtroom  
*(INT. COURTROOM - DAY)*  
**Dr. Roy** testifies, presenting the **chain of custody** documents and lab reports.  

**JUDGE**  
"Based on forensic evidence, Rohit Malhotra is convicted under Section 302, IPC."  

**FINAL SHOT:**  
Dr. Roy exits the court, passing a poster: *"Forensic Science Symposium, NFSU – Justice Through Science."*  

---

### Forensic Accuracies Highlighted:  
1. **DNA Profiling** ([1][38]): Matched through CFSL labs, adhering to the Indian Evidence Act.  
2. **Diatom Testing** ([5][30]): Used to confirm drowning, a standard practice in Indian aquatic death investigations.  
3. **Chain of Custody** ([9][54]): Evidence logs shown align with BNSS Section 176 mandates.  
4. **Ballistic Analysis** ([7][55]): Blade-to-wound matching follows SOPs from DFSS guidelines.  
5. **UV Luminescence** ([21]): Blood detection technique as per crime scene protocols.  

### Cinematic Elements:  
- **Aspect Ratio:** 16:9 for dynamic alleyway chase sequences.  
- **Sound Design:** Foley effects accentuate evidence collection (e.g., knife scrapes, UV light hum).  
- **Color Grading:** Cool tones for lab scenes; stark contrasts in flashbacks.  

This script balances procedural accuracy with narrative tension, showcasing India’s forensic rigor while adhering to competition guidelines[1][9][38].
