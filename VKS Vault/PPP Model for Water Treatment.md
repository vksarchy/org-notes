### **Public-Private Partnership (PPP) in Water Management**

**Public-Private Partnership (PPP)** is a collaborative model where the government partners with private companies to **finance, develop, operate, and maintain** water infrastructure projects. This approach helps improve efficiency, reduce financial burden on the government, and bring in advanced technology.

## **PPP Models in Water Projects**

1. **Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT)** – The private entity builds and operates the infrastructure for a set period before transferring it to the government.
2. **Design-Build-Operate (DBO)** – The private sector designs, builds, and operates the project, while the government owns it.
3. **Hybrid Annuity Model (HAM)** – A mix of government and private funding, where the government provides partial upfront support and the private player recovers the investment over time.
4. **O&M Contracts (Operations & Maintenance)** – The private entity takes over the management and maintenance of existing water infrastructure.
