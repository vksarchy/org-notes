Here’s a structured summary of the **techniques** from Chase Hughes in "The Behaviour Expert: Instantly Read Any Room & How To Hack Your Discipline":

---

## 1. **The Success Triangle**

- **Self-mastery**: Develop confidence, discipline, authority.
    
- **Observation**: Ability to read people and “the room.”
    
- **Communication**: Influence, inspire, and persuade through understanding the other person’s needs.[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvjR9GM2kX8&t=366s)[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvjR9GM2kX8&t=366s)

## 2. **Authority Framework**

- **Five Pillars of Authority**: Confidence, Discipline, Leadership, Gratitude, Enjoyment.
    
    - _Composure_ is key: neither collapse (submissive) nor posturing (overcompensating), but centered.
        
    - **Slowness of movement**: Move and speak more slowly to project authority.
        
- **Physical and Environmental Signals**: How you manage aspects like your environment, time, appearance, social life, and finances subtly project authority and confidence.
    
- “Comfort wins.” Focus on being comfortable in social situations rather than comparison or competition.[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvjR9GM2kX8&t=366s)[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvjR9GM2kX8&t=366s)

## 3. **Observation—Reading People and Rooms**

- **Blink Rate**: Fast blinking means stress or deception; slow blink means focus (or sometimes preying/manipulation).
    
- **Look for changes**, not just isolated behaviors.
    
- **The 5 C’s:**
    
    - Change (in behavior),
        
    - Context (what’s happening?),
        
    - Clusters (multiple cues),
        
    - Culture (cultural background affecting behavior),
        
    - Checklist (reference known indicators, but not in isolation).[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvjR9GM2kX8&t=366s)[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvjR9GM2kX8&t=366s)

## 4. **Communication Mastery**

- **Identify Core Needs**: People communicate from one (or more) of six needs—Significance, Acceptance, Approval, Intelligence, Pity, Strength/Power.
    
- **Adapt to Needs**: Listen for which need is driving them, and tailor your communication accordingly.
    
- _Example_: With someone seeking significance, highlight how your idea or product increases their impact.[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvjR9GM2kX8&t=366s)[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvjR9GM2kX8&t=366s)

## 5. **Persuasion Techniques**

- **Elicitation**: Get information by making statements (not questions), triggering people’s desire to correct you.
    
    - Use disbelief and bracketing to encourage people to volunteer information naturally.[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvjR9GM2kX8&t=366s)[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvjR9GM2kX8&t=366s)
        
- **Identity Agreements**: Get people to agree with statements about who they are (their identity), which strongly influences behavior (cognitive dissonance).
    
- Leverage small public commitments to gradually guide people’s behavior.[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvjR9GM2kX8&t=366s)[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvjR9GM2kX8&t=366s)

## 6. **The FATE Model (Influence Any Mammal)**

- **FATE** stands for:
    
    - Focus (capture attention)
        
    - Authority (show leadership or credibility)
        
    - Tribe (sense of belonging)
        
    - Emotion (create positive/negative emotional associations)
        
- Use combinations to influence choices—works for humans and animals.[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvjR9GM2kX8&t=366s)[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvjR9GM2kX8&t=366s)

## 7. **Discipline and Habit Formation**

- **Discipline = Prioritizing your future self** over the present.
    
- **Technique for building discipline**:
    
    - Start small (micro-habits).
        
    - Set up your environment to lower friction for good behavior (e.g., prep coffee machine the night before).
        
    - Look for ways to thank your “past self” (e.g., leave cash in your coat pocket for a surprise).[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvjR9GM2kX8&t=366s)[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvjR9GM2kX8&t=366s)
        
    - Visual reinforcement: Use vision boards and imagery to build a "mammalian" emotional connection to your goals.
        
- Discipline is only necessary at the beginning; once a habit is formed, it becomes automatic.
    
- _Brainwashing for habits_: Focus, Emotion, Agitation (disrupt routines), Repetition (“FEAR” acronym).[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvjR9GM2kX8&t=366s)[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvjR9GM2kX8&t=366s)

## 8. **Dealing with Arguments and Manipulation**

- **Winning arguments**: Don’t fact check small details in the moment; clarify shared outcomes first.
    
- **FOG**: Recognize when someone is manipulating with Fear, Obligation, or Guilt—gently call it out and give them a “golden bridge” to retreat non-confrontationally.
    
- **Listen for underlying emotions**—not just surface complaints.[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvjR9GM2kX8&t=366s)[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvjR9GM2kX8&t=366s)

## 9. **Social Media and Environmental Cues**

- Be cautious of tools/products that can’t explain the problem they solve (“be terrified”).
    
- Watch for fractionation (emotional rollercoaster) in apps—ups and downs increase suggestibility.
    
- Empathy diminishes in larger “tribes” (big cities or online groups), mirroring the bystander effect.[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvjR9GM2kX8&t=366s)[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvjR9GM2kX8&t=366s)
