Subvention schemes, popular in the mid-
2010s, created thorny problems. Developers
assured banks they would pay buyers’ EMIs
until possession. When projects stalled,
banks turned to buyers, damaging credit
scores and leaving families in unfinished
homes. Moorthy himself had firsthand ex-
perience. “I was caught in one such scheme,”
he recalls. “It took me five years of litigation,
hundreds of emails and hearings, to recover
my money with interest. If this can happen
to someone in the industry, imagine what it
means for an ordinary buyer without legal
guidance.

 Prevention
is still far less painful than litigation years
down the line,” he says.

RERA Promises: 

RERA was introduced as a reform to
bring in transparency and account-
ability to the real estate sector, cover-
ing both residential and commercial
projects and applying to private and
public bodies engaged in sales.
Under RERA, projects above 500
square meters or eight apartments
must be registered before launch,
and real estate agents are required
to register with state authorities—
measures intended to curb misrep-
resentation and prevent marketing
of unapproved developments. The
law also provides buyers with clear
remedies. If a developer fails to deliver
on time, the buyer can seek a refund
with interest or claim monthly inter-
est until possession is handed over.
Additionally, RERA’s online portals
offer access to project details, time-
lines, and approvals, helping buyers
make informed decisions.
On paper, RERA empowers home-
buyers with significant rights; how-
ever, in practice, enforcement and
implementation challenges remain.

Why issues persist
Even with RERA in place for nearly a
decade, many homebuyers continue to
face the same problems that plagued
the sector before its introduction—
projects delivered without occupancy
certificates, poor construction qual-
ity, and promised amenities falling
short. Experts say the problem lies
not with the law but with its uneven
enforcement across states
