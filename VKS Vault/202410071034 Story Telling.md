## My notes from reading the book 2nd time:

Sometimes the closest place to start is thirty years before your five-second moment. If that’s the case, so be it. But when that beginning can be pushed closer to the five-second moment, your audience will be the better for it.  
  
Soderbergh starts his stories as close to the ending as possible. He gets it.  
  
Here are a couple more practical tips for choosing an opening:  
1. Try to start your story with forward movement whenever possible.  
2. Don’t start by setting expectations.  
  
We open on the protagonist or someone similarly important to the story. That person will be moving. Walking. Running. Driving. Flying. Climbing. Fleeing. Falling. Swimming. Crawling. Diving. Filmmakers want to immerse you into their world as quickly as possible  
  
If you are telling a story about a five-second moment of your life — a moment of transformation, realization, or revelation — you’re doing well.  
  
If you’ve also found the right place to begin your story — a place that represents the opposite of your five-second moment, and one as close to the ending as possible — you’ve established a clear frame and arc in your story. You’ve identified the direction your story is headed in  
  
STAKES  
Just imagine if I asked a friend, “Would you like to go to a movie where a man who does not believe in God ultimately finds the faith required to save himself and the woman he loves?” - NO  
  
see Raiders of the Lost Ark? It’s a movie about an archeologist-turned-hero who must battle Nazis, snakes, booby traps, and evil scientists in order to save the world?”  
The answer is more likely to be yes.  
  
• The Elephant  
It is a clear statement of the need, the want, the problem, the peril, or the mystery. It signifies where the story is headed, and it makes it clear to your audience that this is in fact a story and not a simple musing on a subject  
The Elephant is the difference between these two beginnings of a story:  
Version #1  
My mother was the kind of woman whom everyone adored. The model of decorum and civility. She served as PTO president and treasurer of the ladies’ auxiliary. She was the only female umpire in our town’s Little League. She baked and knit and grew vegetables by the pound.  
Version #2  
I don’t care how perfect my mother was. When I was nine years old, I wanted to disown her. Leave home and never return. Forget she ever existed. My mother was the kind of woman whom everyone adored. The model of decorum and civility. She served as PTO president and treasurer of the ladies’ auxiliary. She was the only female umpire in our town’s Little League. She baked and knit and grew vegetables by the pound.  
The first story offers a character sketch of the storyteller’s mother. We have no idea what kind of story we are listening to, so it’s easy for us to check out at this point. Nothing is at stake. There is no wonder. We don’t need to hear the next sentence.  
The second story starts with an Elephant. It contains exactly the same character description, but it opens with a clear explanation of what to expect.  
“When I was nine years old, I wanted to disown her. Leave home and never return. Forget she ever existed.”  
The audience has a good idea of the story being told, and it’s likely that they will want to hear more. Now they have something to wonder about  
  
Elephants can also change color. That is, the need, want, problem, peril, or mystery stated in the beginning of the story can change along the way. You may be offered one expectation only to have it pulled away in favor of another.  
Start with a gray Elephant. End with a pink one.

*Backpacks*  
A Backpack is a strategy that increases the stakes of the story by increasing the audience’s anticipation about a coming event. It’s when a storyteller loads up the audience with all the storyteller’s hopes and fears in that moment before moving the story forward. It’s an attempt to do two things:  
1. Make the audience wonder what will happen next.  
2. Make your audience experience the same emotion, or something like the same emotion, that the storyteller experienced in the moment about to be described  
*Backpacks are most effective when a plan does not work*
If I had described my plan for begging for gas, and then the plan worked perfectly, there would have been no payoff for the Backpack.  
  
*Breadcrumbs*  
Storytellers use Breadcrumbs when we hint at a future event but only reveal enough to keep the audience guessing.  
In “Charity Thief,” I drop a Breadcrumb when I say:  
But as I climb back into the car, I see my crumpled McDonald’s uniform on the backseat, and I suddenly have an idea.  
  
*Hourglasses*  
The sentence your audience has been waiting to hear.  
This is the moment to use an Hourglass. It’s time to slow things down. Grind them to a halt when possible. When you know the audience is hanging on your every word, let them hang. Drag out the wait as long as possible.  
In addition to adding in superfluous detail and summary, I’ll slow my pace as I approach this sentence. I will reduce my volume. I want the audience on the edge of their seats, desperately awaiting those twelve words.  
It’s the perfect time to use an Hourglass.  

Stakes. The desire of an audience to hear the next sentence, made greater by the deliberate slowing down of action and pace  
  
*Crystal Balls*  
The Crystal Ball is the easiest of the strategies to deploy, because you already use Crystal Balls in everyday life. A Crystal Ball is a false prediction made by a storyteller to cause the audience to wonder if the prediction will prove to be true.  
*Eg:* You might tell your significant other, “The boss called me into her office this morning, and as I walked down the hall, I just knew I had done something wrong and was getting fired. This was it. The end of the road for me. It was the longest walk of my life. When I stepped into her office, she told me that I was being promoted.”  
Or “I was sure that my boyfriend forgot my birthday again, but when I got home, he had a surprise party waiting for me.”  
Or “For the first four decades of my life, I thought brie was disgusting simply because of the way it looked. But tonight I tried brie for the first time, and I can’t believe what I’ve been missing.”  
  
  
*Humor*  
Humor doesn’t actually add to or raise the stakes of a story. It doesn’t give your audience a reason to listen for the next sentence. It doesn’t increase the level of suspense or peril or mystery. But it’s a way of keeping your audience’s attention through a section of your story that you think might be less than compelling.

# Start your story with: 

**Location and Action** 
I’m standing in the middle of my kitchen, watching my cat chase a fly,” you can already see that kitchen.

I am often asked how I manage to create such vivid images in the minds of my audience. My answer: I avoid adjectives. I try not to describe things unless absolutely necessary. Instead, I leverage memory by choosing good, hard nouns that people can already see simply by naming (such as a “Schwinn ten-speed” or “Kraft American singles”). We want our audiences to become lost in the movie we are creating in their minds. We can do that by allowing them to choose the familiar, well-known, crystal-clear imagery that already exists in their mind’s eye.

Avoid Setting Expectations

Start with story. Not with a summary of the story. There is no need to describe the tone at the onset of the story. No need to say, “This is a story about how I fell in love with my husband on a park bench in Central Park.


Avoid Exposition


Storytellers often feel the need to start stories by explaining or teaching the audience something that will be relevant to the story. They might describe their hometown or the social dynamic of their high school. In business, they might overview the state of the economy as it applies to their particular company.

Don’t do any of this. Instead, start with the story.

My story of Jeff Durand delivering newspapers to desperate employment seekers back in 1985 teaches the audience about the technology, processes, and power dynamics of the employment sector of forty years ago, but it does so by telling a story. I begin with a time and place (location) and forward movement (action), and as the story plays out, the audience learns about the realities and limitations of the market at the time.

Telling a story is an engaging, entertaining way to teach an audience what they need to know. Rather than offering a preemptive history or economics lesson, I begin with a boy on a bike and the assertion that he is changing the world.

It makes an audience want to hear more.
