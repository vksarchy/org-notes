# Readme

This notes system is an organised collection of all my experiments,
research and ideas. I like to think of it like finding the Half Blood
Prince's annotated spells book. This collection is based on the idea
that a note should be around 100 words and stictly contains only one
idea per file. It should work in most plain-text note applications
like Obsidian or '[zk](https://github.com/zk-org/zk)' on the command line. File naming is done with
unique ids. No need to browse by filesystem and this way there is only
one source of what a true title is and links cannot be broken by
renaming. Browsing can be done using '[[upln|depth]]' links.
