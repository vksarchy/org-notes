# Fuji X-E4 - perfect EDC camera?

When combined with the stabilized 15-45 zoom lens, this makes for a
very compelling EDC camera. It is not small enough to fit in a pocket,
but it is compact and light enough for a small bag and can then be
worn around the neck or simply held with a wrist strap as a
walk-around camera.
