# Augmentation as a philosophy for EDC

#idea

For some time now I've used the idea of 'augmentation' as a way to
decide on the devices I always have in my pockets at all times. These
are items with no special purpose other than to boost the
effectiveness of any physical ability to manipulate the world around
us.
