# Zero inbox workflow

My simple approach to inbox zero is to have an 'actioned' folder for
each of my accounts. Once or twice a day, I then act on emails in the
inbox. This may involve replying and moving the email to the action
folder, extracting a to-do and adding it to my time management system,
or just deleting it. Because it's easy to do one of these things to
all messages, there is rarely a reason to leave an email in the inbox,
which leads to frictionless inbox zero.
