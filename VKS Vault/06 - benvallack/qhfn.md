# The case for perescope lights

#idea

As part of my 'augmentation' EDC philosophy, I have carried a small
torch (flashlight) with me at all times for many years. Originally the
Perun Mini, now the Oclip. The style of these lights is that they have
a clip on the back, and the light projects sideways from the unit.
This allows it to be clipped to clothes (or even glasses in the case
of the Oclip) to provide hands-free forward-facing light. The
usefulness of this cannot be overstated.
