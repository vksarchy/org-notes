# Thoughts on the Fuji 15-45 OIS lens

This often overlooked lens is surprisingly good in terms of
stabilization for video and general sharpness and quality. It is so
small and light that it allows for the non-IBIS Fuji bodies to be
turned into a relatively compact EDC camera for hybrid shooters. It
has a cheap plastic build, but that is what allows it to be so small
and light.
