# using depth as a way to link notes

When using a Zettelkasten type system (one note per file) it is useful
to set up a system of linking to allow for thought provoking
exploration of other ideas. Using depth (broader or more specific) is,
I find, a great way to group links from a note. You can link to
broader topics under ‘Up’ and more specific topics under a ‘Down’
heading.
