# Lumix LX100/II - Affordable EDC Camera

The Lumix LX100 and its successors, along with their Leica
counterparts (including the D-Lux 8), make for a very unique option at
a range of price points (original LX100 £300 used, LX100 II £600 used,
D-Lux 8 £1450 new). Colors in video and JPEGs have apparently improved
across all three of these in order. The cameras have a full-frame equivalent
aperture (in terms of depth of field) of f/3.74-6.16 for stills and
f/4-6.7 with the increased crop in video mode. They have pleasing
bokeh and excellent lens characteristics, as well as a viewfinder and
excellent manual controls. It also has suprisingly good OIS in video.
Autofocus in video is unusable though so it's AFS mode only. Also, 
colours on skintones are poor/unusable.
