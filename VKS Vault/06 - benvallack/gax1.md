# install Notmuch

Neomutt can be used with `notmuch` for super fast searching. Install
with `sudo port install notmuch`. Configure in `~/.notmuch-config`.
The magic is the shortcut in the neomutt config that allows you to
filter the view based on the search results. I've [[b4rk|mapped]] this
to `F`.
