# Use Telescope in nvim to insert links

When using [`zk`](https://github.com/zk-org/zk) in nvim, you can set
up a keyboard shortcut in the `Telescope` config to allow for a way to
use `live_grep` to find notes. Set it up to extract the title and
insert the filename without the .md extension to match the
[`zk-nvim`](https://github.com/zk-org/zk-nvim) format. It then becomes
easy to find a note based on tags or keywords (use hashtags in the
notes). 

(Use ChatGPT to create this config; it has no problem with Lua
configs for nvim!)
