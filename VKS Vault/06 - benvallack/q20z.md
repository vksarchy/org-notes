# Using my 30 key layout on Mac hardware

The idea of using thumbs on the bottom row keys doesn't really work on
the staggered layout of the native Mac keyboard due to the extra reach
needed on the left thumb to reach 'b'. I have found that one option is
to use the native spacebar as the left thumb key and just disable the
native 'b'. To the right thumb is the 'n' key.
