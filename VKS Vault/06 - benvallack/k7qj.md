# How to make DIY shower gel

I have found peppermint to be a brilliant essential oil to use in shower gel. Really refreshing.

Make into 300ml bottle:
Liquid Castile Soap: 150 ml
Aloe Vera Gel: 60 ml
Vegetable Glycerin: 30 ml
Distilled Water: 60 ml
Peppermint – 10 drops
Lavender – 4 drops
Rosemary – 3 drops
Geranium or Palmarosa – 1–2 drops
