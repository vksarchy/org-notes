# use a custom layout on Mac hardware

[Kanata](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata) lets you use complete custom
keyboard layouts, including tap holds, combos, and all the advanced
timeout configuration you need to use custom layouts directly on
built-in Mac hardware. The [[v49b|installation process]] is fairly
complicated but the implication of this is huge. It allows you to go
all-in with custom keyboard design and still be able to jump on a
laptop and use it.
