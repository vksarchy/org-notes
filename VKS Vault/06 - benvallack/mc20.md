# Selection process for pry bar

Consider metals: hardened steel far stronger than titanium.
Considering these things are under 20g, the weight saving really isn't
relevant. I have used the Fulcrum mini, but it's soft, expensive, and
has a bit driver that is useless in real life due to its inability to
put pressure on the end. Looking for simpler form factor in steel.
[Widgy Pry Bar](https://countycomm.com/products/widgy-pry-bars) might be the answer.
