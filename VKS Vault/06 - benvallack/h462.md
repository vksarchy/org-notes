# Real time LUTs in Lumix S9

If a camera is going to replace an iPhone in the EDC role, it needs to
add ready-to-enjoy stills and video to my library. The Lumix S9
promises this with its real-time LUTs - this is a fascinating
direction and one that I think is essential for modern EDC cameras. My
concern, though, is that instead of just helping you get 'good' colors
out of the camera, it will just be a sea of 'Insta' style filters. I
still think Fuji's approach wins.
