# use state tags when tagging notes

#idea

Interesting idea to use states rather than categories when tagging
notes. Tags like ‘develop’, ‘experiment’, ‘proof’ etc are useful to
find ideas according to the next action you need to take on them. If
searching by topic it is no problem to use a [[wfgi|grep]] search to look at
all content and tags.
