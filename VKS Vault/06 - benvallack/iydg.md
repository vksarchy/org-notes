# The case for a pocket EDC notebook

#idea

I've carried 4 key items (as well my house keys) in my pockets for a
few years. I've now added a notebook, [[f2j3|pen]] and [[p3f2|pencil]] to this. It's
remarkable how similar this item feels to the other items.  Now I have
the notebook to augment memory and ideation ability. As a device that
is always with me I think this will turn out to be the most
transformative of all.
