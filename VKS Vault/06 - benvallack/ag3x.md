# ebooks are overrated

#idea

As I’ve started researching and reading more, I found myself shying
away from using real books due to the apparent benefit of being able
to add highlights in an ebook. Of course, this is silly. It’s far
better to develop a ‘re-write’ workflow when recording quotes from any
text. Take real notes and rewrite concepts in your own way. Ideally,
do this in handwriting first, then formalize it into a Zettelkasten or
other digital system later. This way, there is no downside to using a
real book.
