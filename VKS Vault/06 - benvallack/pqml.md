# How to make hand soap

Based on a 300ml bottle:
- Add a teaspoon of jojoba oil.
- Then add between 1 teaspoon and 1 tablespoon of vegetable glycerin,
  depending on how 'silky' you want it (more glycerin makes it feel
  slippery under the tap).
- Fill the remaining space equally 1:1 with liquid castile soap and
  water.

Add [[s4fc|essential oil blend]] according to preference
(experiment!).
