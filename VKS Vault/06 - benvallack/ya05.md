# Manual email sync 2 week update

#experience #experiment

So far, I haven't found any issues with missing thread replies as a
result of not having a final look at new unread emails while typing or
before sending. The psychological impact of manually 'checking' for
email reinforces my commitment to dealing with email 'intentionally.'
Rather than feeling like you are trying to catch water by switching
buckets in a waterfall, this feels like you only need to turn on the
tap once you are ready with your bucket.
