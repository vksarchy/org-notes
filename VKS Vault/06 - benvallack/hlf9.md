# My rucksack EDC kit (The Errand Runner 2.0)

In my tiny 10L bag, (£3.99 from Decathlon) I have two [[6wrd|tights stacks]]: 
one with a tool roll and camera (previously ZV-1, now LX100), the
other with a Shakedry coat, shopping bag, car key (keyless entry),
anti-bac wipes, tissues, wallet, and dumbphone. The first version of
this was the Belroy Sling Lite 7L but it was too small once things
like shopping bags, tissues and camera were added.
