# Multitools vs Single-purpose Tools

#idea

“In almost all cases it is better to carry specific items rather than
multitools like a swiss army knife or Leatherman.” I find it better to
start all tool choice decisions with this as a starting point. It may
be that you will make exceptions to the rule but in almost all cases
I've never found a multitool to justify itself over its dedicated
counterparts in real life use.
