# How to maka a lighter moisturiser

Instead of the two-stage moisturiser, a single-stage version without
occlusives might be better for acne-prone skin.

- Aloe vera gel (4 parts) 
- Jojoba (1 part) 
- Essential oils (8-16 drops in a 40ml final amount of product)

Current test blend (acne/balanced):
Geranium (6 drops) + Tea Tree (4 drops) + Lavender (6 drops)
(1% dilution, 16 total drops)
