# Kuru Toga

I tasked my genius* 12 year old son to research mechnical pencils for me and
to my delight he discovered the [uni-ball Kuru
Toga](https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Kuru-Toga-Roulette-Mechanical-Pencil-0.5-mm-Silver-Body/pd/6548).
This pencil has the amazing ability to sharpen its own lead as you
[[iydg|write]] with it. The way it does this is by rotating the lead a
tiny bit each time you press it down. This means it is especially well
suited as a tool for note taking and hand writing. I've found it
extremely enjoyable to use and being able to use the eraser on the end
to revise things without wasting too much space in a small notebook.
