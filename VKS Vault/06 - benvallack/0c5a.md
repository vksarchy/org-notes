# Why email is still unbeaten

#idea

Email still manages to solve the problem of digital communication
incredibly well. It has avoided the fate of the instant messaging apps
where an expectation of instant response has developed (encouraged by
big tech looking for ways to give us a reason to ‘engage’ with our
phones). An email can be sent any time with only the loose expectation
that it will get a reply ‘in due course.’ Email is also largely unique
among the messaging platforms in that it allows for messages to be
filed using folders.
