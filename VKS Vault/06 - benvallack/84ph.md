# The case for manual email sync

#idea

After switching to Neomutt, I found myself using manual email sync.
This is interestingly still an option in email apps like Apple Mail.
Email is [[0c5a|unbeatable]] because it doesn't have the expectation
of an immediate response; don't undermine that benefit by habitually
checking your email. Leroy [[d402|study]] proves the devastating
impact of attention residue when switching tasks or being distracted.
