# downside of using rucksack for EDC

#problem

When using a rucksack one of the main issues is storage of items in
the space. Most bags tend to have very limited mechanisms for keeping
items ‘stacked’. This means items will naturally fall down to the
bottom, ending up with unneccesary bulk at the bottom and unused space
at the top.
