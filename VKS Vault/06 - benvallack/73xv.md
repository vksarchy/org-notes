# The case for the Widgy Pry Tool

I am drawn to the idea of single-purpose tools. Pry-bar design is very
prone to dilution with additonal 'features'. My search for a pry bar
that is only a pry bar might have conculded with the [Widgy Pry](https://countycomm.com/products/widgy-pry-bars) bar.
Very compact, stronger that titanium and affordable.
