# install Kanata

Installing Kanata is a bit of a headache due to the dependency on the
[Karabiner
driver](https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-DriverKit-VirtualHIDDevice).
Version [1.8.0](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/releases/tag/v1.8.0)
has a dependency on
[v5](https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-DriverKit-VirtualHIDDevice/releases/tag/v5.0.0)
of the Karabiner driver. Version
[1.7.0](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/releases/tag/v1.7.0) uses
[v3](https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-DriverKit-VirtualHIDDevice/releases/tag/v3.2.0)
of the driver. The driver has its own macOS support versioning. V4 and
above drop support for Monterey and below. For me on Monterey, this
means using version 1.7.0. Each version has its own specific install
steps, so it's important to reference the install steps for the
relevant release.
