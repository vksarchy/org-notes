# Moment of inertia and portability

#idea

If you consider a device like a laptop and increase its length and
width by a factor of something fairly small, say 1.2, its moment of
inertia (how much effort is needed to rotate it in space) will
increase by a factor closer to around 2. This effect makes the size of
a device intended for portability especially important and why one
shouldn't underestimate the impact of going to a 13" laptop over
something like the amazingly small 12" MacBook (2017).
