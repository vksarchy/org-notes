# install Neomutt on Mac

Neomutt is a command line tool that offers a very unusual approach to
email. It's extremey fiddly to setup but the reward is huge. Install
Neomutt on Mac with `sudo port install neomutt +kyotocabinet` (the
option allows for header_caching to work if using MacPorts) and configure it in
`~/.config/mutt/muttrc`.
