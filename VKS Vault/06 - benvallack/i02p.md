# EDC Camera Selection Process

I really enjoy using 'real' cameras instead of smartphones and have
developed the following criteria for selection:

- Around 400-500g and compact as possible
- Should have an EVF or screen that is bright enough to use in the sun
  (not sure this exists really)
- Good color in JPEG and video out of the camera
- Prioritize user experience
- 24-70 zoom or a big enough sensor to allow this in lossless cropping
  (12MP for stills to get 70mm is acceptable)
- Full frame equivalent aperture of f/4-5 or less around 24mm FOV for
  background blur without zooming in.
- Sensor size not as important as full frame equiv. depth of field  
- IBIS or OIS that is good enough for handheld video (doesn't need to
  be good enough for walking!)
- Rangefinder controls - so much nicer than PASM
