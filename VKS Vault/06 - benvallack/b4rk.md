# neomutt keyboard shortcuts

Use my two-layer vim-motion/arrow keys for navigating the sidebar and
the index. Vim motion ‘up’ and ‘down’ (`o` and `a` on the main layer)
change the selected email. Vim motion ‘left’ and ‘right’ (`h` and `e`
on the main layer) switch between the email index and the selected
item. `Up` and `Down` change sidebar folder focus, `Right` selects.
Use `Space` to tag an email. Use `S` to [[ei1h|sync]] with `mbsync`.
Use `d` and `u` to scroll up and down a page. `A` is a macro to move
the selected folder into an ‘Archive’ folder with no prompts or
confirmation. `F` to search with `notmuch`.
