# strength through real work simulation

#experiment

Always struck by the difference in routine between people who use
strength for work (construction, etc.) and weight training
enthusiasts. We hear about hypertrophy, DOMS, and needing rest days.
These are all detrimental to real-life strength goals where daily
performance (without injury) is key. To recreate
this at home, we can use a [sandbag](https://amzn.to/41z4m77). Aim to start with half your body
weight. Move it from upstairs to outside, incorporate pull-ups, yoga,
etc. Do this a few times per day. Putting it down to put shoes in etc
is all good. Focus on good back position.
