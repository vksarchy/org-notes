# the overlap between handwriting and typing

#idea

I've found myself enjoying learning cursive, and it occurred to me
that developing the proper muscle memory to write smoothly at speed is
very similar to learning to type properly. Muscle memory for the whole
word needs to be learned. In both cases, it's possible to type and
write slowly, but to do it fast, you have to pursue perfection in the
execution. A word needs to be typed with 100% accuracy in one go.
Similar feel to learning a musical instrument - it has to come from
the subconscious/muscle memory.
