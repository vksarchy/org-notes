# How to print guides for learning Spencerian

One of the hardest parts of learning handwriting is keeping the
proportions consistent. With Spencerian, there is quite a specific set
of ratios to the x-height (i-height according to the Theory of
Spencerian Penmanship) and also the widths of the letters. This
excellent tool generates the rules and 52º slant lines so you can
print them out.
