# How to make diswasher powder

Mix 2 parts soda crystals to 1 part bicarbonate of soda. Add essential
oils by pre-mixing in a small amount (10-20 drops in a few
tablespoons), then add. I used about 20 drops in a final amount of
about 250ml. This will work on greasy and generally dirty plates, but
it will not attack protein-based residue like commercial powders with
enzymes in them. Enzymes seem hard to find but do seem available as a
laundry additive; I will experiment.
