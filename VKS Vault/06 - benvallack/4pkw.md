# How to make laundry liquid

For 500ml:
50g Soda Crystals
25g Sodium Bicarbonate
125ml Liquid Castile Soap
325ml Water
Essential oils (~10 drops, lemon and lavender work well)

Dissolve soda crystals and bicarbonate in 125ml of the water (warmed).
Add the soap slowly (I did get a bit of separation but just kept mixing it up; I don't think it affects performance).
Add the remaining water and essential oils.
