# Thoughts on Sony RX100 Cameras

On the face of it, the RX100 line of cameras seems to be one of the
best EDC camera options. The early models have fast lenses, and the
later models have a greater zoom range at the cost of the f1.8.
However, if you think about using them as a YouTube camera, only the
VII has no record limit, and that forces you to choose the f2.8
version. The most defining differentiator between that and the ZV-1 is
the viewfinder, but people say the popup style doesn't shade your eye
from the sun.
