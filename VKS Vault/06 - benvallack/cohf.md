# My experience with DIY deodorant

After using DIY deodorant for a few months, it is clear that the
bicarb-based deodorant is extremely effective. However, I have noticed
irritation if I use it for extended periods. I have started making
sure I only leave it on during the day and include days off where I
don't use it at all (sorry, family!). I will try a milder alternative
on the next batch.
