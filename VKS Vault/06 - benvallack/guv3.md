# the case for dedicated kits to avoid a big EDC

#idea #experiment

When considering how much kit to carry with you in an ‘everyday’ bag,
it's worth considering if you are carrying it to compensate for a lack
of organized storage of items in the home or car. I currently value having a
‘complete’ kit in my EDC bag, but in fact, it would probably be better
to duplicate the items in considered locations in my home and car and
avoid the need to carry them with me. This could be called a ‘nuclear’
kit vs ‘satelite’ kits.
