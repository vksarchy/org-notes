# Fuji x100vi limited resolution

On paper, this comes quite close to meeting my [[i02p|EDC camera
selection]] requirements. The 40MP sensor allows for cropping to get
to a 12MP image at 64mm full frame equivalent fov. Unfortunately,
according to The Hybrid Shooter, the real perceived detail is only
around 24MP, which means it's unlikely to be a high-quality 12MP crop.
Working with the fixed focal length could, of course, be 'embraced' as
part of its charm, but with family photos at the beach, I often find
myself at the tele end of my zoom, so I think, in reality, this would
be limiting, and of course, with no option to change lenses.
