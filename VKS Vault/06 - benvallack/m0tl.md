# encrypted password storage

There are command line tools called `pass` and `gpg` that can be used
to store passwords encrypted. Both can be installed on Mac with `sudo
port install gnupg2 pass`. Use `pass init` and `pass insert` to add
your passwords, and then you can use `pass your_email_or_username` to
retrieve your passwords in your config files.
