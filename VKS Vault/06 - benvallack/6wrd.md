# using tights to stack items in a rucksack

#idea #experiment

It occurred to me that using tights is an effective way to keep items
stacked and stable when carrying multiple items in a rucksack. In my
testing so far this seems to be working really well, but it does look
absurd. Using black instead of 'nude' would be better!
