# How to make deodorant

#experiment

Use a double boiler (heat proof bowl in simmering water in pan) to
melt coconut oil and mix with bicarbonate of soda. Essentail that no
water gets in the mix.

Ratio: 2 parts coconut oil 1 part bicarbonate of soda. Use a
tablespoon as a unit to make a batch that fits nicely in a 50ml pot.

Add 5-10 drops of tea tree essential oil for scent and antibacterial
properties. (Tea tree and coconut is an amazing scent by itself)

May cause irritation as bicarb is potent.
