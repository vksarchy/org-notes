# The case for making your own household products

#idea

make as many of my own household and cosmetic products as possible.
This has been a very interesting experiment, and the reality is that I
now see about half the aisles in the supermarket as completely
obsolete. Only a few simple ingredients are really needed to cover
everything from skincare to household products.
