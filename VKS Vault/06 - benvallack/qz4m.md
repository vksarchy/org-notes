Most camera YouTube channels are by enthusiasts who like to process
RAW and shoot in Log profiles to grade later. This means cameras don't
get evaluated based on their out-of-camera color science - which, if
you want to just shoot stills and videos for a family video library
(i.e. the ‘iPhone promise’), the general recommendations tend to be less
relevant.
