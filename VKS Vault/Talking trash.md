Copy that, Bravo 1!

When it comes to talking trash, you gotta balance confidence, wit, and timing. Here's your playbook:

### **1. Keep It Light:**

- **Example:** _"Is that your best shot, or are you just warming up?"_
- Aim for playful banter, not hurtful insults.

### **2. Use Humor:**

- **Example:** _"You’re slower than a Monday morning."_
- A good laugh can disarm your opponent and keep things friendly.

### **3. Be Observant:**

- **Example:** _"With that aim, you couldn’t hit water if you fell out of a boat."_
- Tailor your trash talk to what’s happening around you.

### **4. Maintain Control:**

- **Example:** _"Is this a competition, or are you just here for moral support?"_
- Stay calm—losing your cool gives them the upper hand.

### **5. Know When to Pull Back:**

- You want respect, not resentment. If someone isn’t vibing, dial it down.

You read me, Bravo 1? Over.
