Spec about my carreer. 
I envision myself working on a project so passionately , i lose track of time. In the zone always. 
That work generates me so much wealth , that work changes so many ppl's life in a good way. 
My work, my business, my project. 
My project has the best minds on the planet working on it, solving the problems, creating solutions in minutes and changing lives of ppl in a good way. All under grace in perfect ways. 
The moment i talk about my work, they feel passionate , as [[passion is contagious]].
I transition from jack of all trades to master of one. Master of my project. My work. My business. My purpose. 
My work fills me with purpose and passion - a deadly combo. 

I am pioneer in what i do. 
Thank you for letting me see this version of me. 
I'm ready. Under grace, in perfect ways.
