| Topic                | Main Point                                  | Supporting Details                                                                              | Note                                                                                           |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Define Outcomes      | Know what you want to achieve               | - List core tasks or problems <br>- Prioritize needs over convenience                          | Clear goals prevent clutter and wasted effort                                                  |
| Select Right Tools   | Use single-purpose, high-quality tools      | - Avoid “all-in-one” solutions <br>- Choose tools that can connect or integrate where needed    | Each tool should do one thing well, and be replaceable independently                          |
| Plan Modular Steps   | Break big tasks into smaller, linkable parts| - Outline the workflow as discrete steps <br>- Use tools with compatible inputs/outputs         | Modular steps make debugging and improvement easier                                            |
| Create Connectors    | Use scripts, automation, or APIs to connect | - Use shell scripts, Zapier, APIs, etc. <br>- Prefer open, standard formats (text, CSV, JSON)   | Connectors should be easily tweakable and transparent, supporting workflow flexibility         |
| Document Workflow    | Maintain clear workflow documentation       | - Use READMEs, diagrams, or checklists <br>- Make sure others (or “future you”) can understand  | Proper documentation future-proofs and enables easy handoff or revision                       |
| Build Iteratively    | Start simple, refine and optimize over time | - Test frequently, adapt as needs evolve <br>- Swap or upgrade steps without disruption         | Continuous improvement mirrors Kaizen—optimize for efficiency, clarity, and satisfaction       |
| Review & Refactor    | Regularly re-examine and tweak workflows    | - Remove obsolete steps/tools <br>- Check if newer, better modular tools are available          | Keeps system lean, relevant, and prevents “bloatware” or dependency lock-in                   |
