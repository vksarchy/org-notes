### How to implement in your upcoming projects:

Flexible "Half Room": Design the 0.5 room to be multi-purpose (office/prayer/study/kids/guest). Keep size around 8x10 feet.

Modular Design: Offer sliding partitions or modular enclosures so buyers can decide—open, enclose, or expand as needed.

Natural Light & Air: Position the half room to maximize window/ventilation or as a quiet "corner office" that still feels integrated.

Smart Storage: Use built-ins or convertible furniture (a murphy bed, fold-away desk) for maximum utility.

Marketing: Highlight how the extra space increases usability—remote work, hobbies, study, stay-over guests—making it future-proof.

Affordability: Ensure the price gap between 2 BHK and 2.5 BHK isn’t too wide to attract middle-income buyers.

Target Cities: Focus on metro and IT hubs (like Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad) where demand is highest and remote/hybrid work is common.

Emphasize the adaptability for evolving lifestyles, long-term investment, and better resale/rental value to both end-users and investorsow to implement in your upcoming projects:
