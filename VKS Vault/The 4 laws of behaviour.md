The **4 laws of behavior** mentioned in the YouTube Short "Why You Act the Way You Do" by Chase Hughes are:

1. **Everyone is suffering and insecure.**
    
2. **Everyone wears a mask.**
    
3. **Everyone pretends not to wear a mask.**
    
4. **Behind every behavior is a positive intent.**
    

These laws help you see yourself and others with more compassion and understanding, revealing the hidden motivations and struggles beneath people's actions.
