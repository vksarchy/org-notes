**Yoshi Tarunaga** (often styled as *Yoshii Toranaga* in popular media) is actually a fictionalized name inspired by the real historical figure **Tokugawa Ieyasu**. In timeline terms, Tokugawa Ieyasu/Toranaga is crucial in the **late medieval period**, specifically in the following era:

***

## **Sengoku Period (1467–1603)**
- **Tokugawa Ieyasu (the inspiration for Yoshi Tarunaga)** was a central warlord in this era.
- He was one of the "Three Great Unifiers" of Japan alongside **Oda Nobunaga** (his predecessor) and **Toyotomi Hideyoshi**.
- Ieyasu rose to prominence after the death of Nobunaga and Hideyoshi, ultimately defeating rival clans and armies in the famous **Battle of Sekigahara (1600)**.
- He then established the **Tokugawa Shogunate** in 1603, which would rule Japan for over 250 years.

**In the documentary’s timeline:**
- **Yoshi Tarunaga (Tokugawa Ieyasu)** comes into prominence *after* the Kamakura and Muromachi periods, following the turmoil and fragmentation of the Sengoku period.
- His era marks the absolute end of medieval Japan and the beginning of the Edo period, bringing unprecedented peace and stability.
