- This affirmation is to be spoken aloud as a declaration that marks the end of drifting and the beginning of decisive living1.
    

**3. "I demand of myself the full attainment of my definite chief aim. I believe I will receive it. I act daily toward it. It shall be mine."**

- The author provides this as a model affirmation for autosuggestion, instructing you to say it with strength and certainty, morning and night, to reprogram your subconscious mind1.
    

**4. "I repeat my aim until it becomes identity. I act daily and let no excuse speak louder than my decision."**

    - "I am the type of person who moves with purpose."
        
    - "I am the type of person who speaks belief into himself daily."
        
    - "I am the type of person who does not consult the past for permission."
        
- These are to be recited daily as declarations of your new identity, not as wishes but as commands for transformation1.
    

**7. "I persist when others pause. I grow through repetition. I finish what I begin. I do not retreat."**

- This affirmation is to be written down and repeated as a shield against fatigue, temptation, and the urge to give up, reinforcing persistence1.
    

**8. "I think with clarity. I separate truth from noise. I correct myself daily and rise stronger every time."**

- This affirmation is to be used during daily reflection, reinforcing accurate thinking and self-correction1.
    

**9. "From this day forward, I think with power. I move with certainty. I build my aim into reality. And I will never again call myself lost."**

- The final affirmation, meant to seal your transformation and become the rhythm of your daily life, marking the end of indecision and the beginning of decisive, purposeful living1.
