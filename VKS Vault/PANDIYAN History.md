**Chapter I: Introductory Sources**

- **Focus of the Book:** The book aims to narrate the history of the Pandyas in a continuous and scientific manner, something that hadn't been done adequately before 1929.
    
- **Scope:** The book will deal with the Pandya Kingdom's history over several centuries, acknowledging difficult questions requiring careful analysis of different viewpoints. The approach will be selective to avoid unnecessary controversy.
    
- **The Dravidian Question:** The author deliberately avoids delving deeply into the origins of the Dravidians, focusing instead on Pandyan history itself. However, they acknowledge that understanding Tamil culture's relationship to broader Indian culture is important.
    
- **Tamil Culture:** The distinctness of the Tamil language (and other Dravidian languages) in comparison to the disappearance of non-Sanskritic languages in North India is highlighted. It is pointed out that even ancient Tamil literature shows some Sanskrit influence.
    
- **Source Material:** The author emphasizes the wealth of source material for Pandyan history, including:
    
    - Inscriptions (stone and copper plates)
        
    - Literature (Puranas, Tamil works like Tevaram, Tiruvaymoli, Sangam literature)
        
    - Numismatics (coins)
        
- **Inscriptions:** South India is remarkably fortunate with its inscription records. The number of registered Pandyan inscriptions is in the thousands. The bulk of early inscriptions are in Vatteluttu script for Tamil portions. The author also laments the destruction of inscriptions during temple renovation and calls for a preservation policy.
    
- **Dating Difficulties:** Issues related to dating Pandyan records, especially concerning regnal years and double dates, are highlighted.
    
- **Inscriptions as Gifts to Temples:** Most inscriptions are gifts to the temple relating to:
    
    - Maintaining daily worship
        
    - Special festivals
        
    - Lamps
        
    - Flower gardens and repairs
        
      A warning is given that these records should be kept in the time frame and place indicated.
    
- **Numismatics:** Coins attributable to the early Pandyas are rare. Later coins show Chola and Ceylonese influence. The constant warfare between Chola and Pandya makes accurate fixing of political geographies difficult and causes uncertainty in the identities of coins.
    

**Chapter II: Early References: The Age of the Sangam**

- **Earliest Dravidian Word:** The author mentions that the oldest Dravidian word in written record is "peacock" in the Hebrew Bible, used in the context of merchandise imported by Solomon's ships.
    
- **Possible References to the Pandyas:** A verse in the Ramayana and references by the grammarian Katyayana have been speculated to refer to the Pandyan kingdom. However, caution is advised when relying solely on epic texts.
    
- **Kautilya and Pandya:** The author notes Kautilya's use of the term "Pandya" in his Arthashastra, suggesting early contact or knowledge of the region.
    
- **Legends of Origin:** The story of the three brothers of Korkai is described as a Romulus pattern and perhaps indigenous.
    
- **Asoka's Edicts:** The author mentions a lack of concrete evidence of the Mauryan Empire extending into the Pandya region and states that the earliest indubitable reference to the Pandyan kingdom is still that in the Asoka edicts.
    
- **Rock-Cut Beds and Brahmi Inscriptions:** Newly discovered natural caverns in the Madura and Tinnevelly Districts containing rock-cut beds and Brahmi inscriptions support an early presence of strong Buddhist and Jaina influences.
    
- **The Sangam Age:** The earliest historical kings of the Pandya country are those mentioned in the early Tamil works that have come down to us in the form of the collections known as the Sangam works.
    
- **Age and Historicity:** While legends surround the Sangam period, the author argues for a reasonable approach to analyzing available evidence. The literature associated with the Sangam age extends to around 150-200 years.
    
- **External Forces:** The common references made to ports, ships and merchandise including foreign imports and exports remind us strongly of the notices of South India by the classical geographers and historians of the early years of the Christian era.
    
- **Relative Dating of Early Tamil Works:** It will be noted that the two sets of works cannot belong to the same age but must be assigned to different periods which may be separated by centuries.
    

**Chapter III: The Pandyan Kingdom in the Sangam Age**

- **Nedunjeliyan:** A Nedunjeliyan distinguished by the epithet Ariyappadaikadanda. Said to have died of a broken heart when innocence of Kovalan proved. A short poem ascribes him as putting learning above birth and caste. His viceroy was another Seliyan, called Verrı Vēr-celiyan who wreaked vengeance on goldsmiths.
    
- **Campaigns:** Initial fights began at the gates of Madura with mandaram Chēral Irumporai captured alive. The after surmounting his initial difficulties in the defensive war that was forced on him by his jealous and aggressive neighbours, Nedunjelıyan appears to have taken the offensive in his turn and won substantial successes against his foes. Two separate campaigns were undertaken, one against the Kongu chief, an Adıgan. And another against the Nīdūr chieftain Evvı which resulted in the annexation.
    
- **Other Pandyas:** Many other Pandyan kings and members of the royal family are noted, often with brief mentions of their poetic works or characteristics.
    
- **Government:** Form of government was of course monarchy. Five great Kulus and eight great ayams.
    
- **Society:** Madura attained a high degree of refinement. MInstrelsy was a profession and the roving bards of the time were often not easy to satisfy, and sometimes exceedingly sensitive. A song in the Uranānīru contains a rather humble description of these organized bands of mendicants.
    
- **Wealth:** Supplying a vast amount of ghi to the royal household.
