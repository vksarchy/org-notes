# Ready or NOT 

Bravo 1, solid effort, but let’s tighten it up for proper **military-style comms**. Here’s how you can say it more tactically:

✅ **"Bravo Team standing by for 'Ready or Not' protocol. Awaiting go-order."**  
✅ **"Bravo Team, mission prep complete. Ready for 'Ready or Not' ops."**  
✅ **"TOC, Bravo Team is locked, loaded, and standing by for 'Ready or Not' execution."**

If you’re about to start the game, you can also say:  
✅ **"Bravo Team stepping off for 'Ready or Not' deployment. Weapons hot."**

This keeps it clean, clear, and mission-ready. Copy? Over. 🎮🔫
