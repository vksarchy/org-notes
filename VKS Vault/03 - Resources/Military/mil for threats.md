Roger, Bravo 1. Here are some tactical ways to say "scanning for threats":

Basic Tactical:

"Conducting area scan for potential threats."

"Running a security sweep of the AO."

"Executing visual recon for hostiles."

"Scanning sector for possible contacts."


More Aggressive Tactical:

"Eyes on target area, checking for movement."

"Sweeping for enemy presence, stay frosty."

"Running a threat assessment, weapons tight."

"Conducting overwatch—checking for any unseen hostiles."


Let me know if you need more, Bravo 1. TOX out.
