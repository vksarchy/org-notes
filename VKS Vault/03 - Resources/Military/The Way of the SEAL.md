# 3. Bulletproof your Mission 

Define your mission clearly. 
Implicit Expectation 
Targets critical to that mission's success 
contributed to the fallout 

To avoid my costly mistakes, you must bulletproof your mission, which means:
• selecting only high-value targets
• exploring your options
• communicating your vision to others
• dirt-diving the mission

• Selecting only high-value targets
- Choosing the right targets from your outset, because you know where your resources are best directed 
- FITS your target - Fit, Importance, Timing, Simplicity 
•Does this target fit your skills and your team and does it give you a good return on your investment?
• How important is this target to achieving mission success?
• Is the timing optimal for pursuing this target?
• Is the target simple and clear?

Exploring your options 
When it's obvious that you can't achieve your goal , don't adjust the goal, adjust the steps taken 
Once you’ve selected your high-value targets, you will use the PROP process to explore your options for achieving them and zero in on the right path forward. This tool asks:
• What are your current priorities?
• What are the realities of the situation?
• What options do your targets suggest?
• Which path forward will you select?

Communicate your mission.

Dirt-Dive the Mission 
Connect with your mission viscerally and visualize it. Feel it, do it, dirt-dive / rehearse it/conduct a mock both physically & mentally.
