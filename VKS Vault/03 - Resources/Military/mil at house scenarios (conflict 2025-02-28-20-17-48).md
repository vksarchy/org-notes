Alright, let's create a few in-house military mission scenarios with tactical planning using military lingo. We'll call your character "Operator" and use "Carlos" as the objective or target, depending on the scenario.
Scenario 1: Secure and Extract (Carlos is a Hostage)
 * Situation: Hostile individuals have taken over a residential structure and are holding "Carlos," a high-value asset, hostage.
 * Mission: Secure the structure, neutralize hostiles, and extract Carlos with minimal casualties.
 * Tactical Plan (Military Lingo):
   * Intel: Gather all available intel on the structure's layout, number of hostiles (estimated enemy strength - EES), their armament, and Carlos's location.
   * Recon: Conduct a visual reconnaissance (recon) of the structure's exterior, identifying entry points (EPs), windows, and potential blind spots.
   * Entry: Utilize a "dynamic entry" (breach and clear) through a designated EP. Establish a "foothold" (secure initial area).
   * Movement: Employ "bounding overwatch" (sequential movement with covering fire) to clear rooms and hallways. Utilize "pieing" (slicing the pie) techniques to clear corners and blind spots.
   * Hostage Rescue: Upon locating Carlos, establish a "protective cordon" (secure perimeter) around him. Utilize "verbal commands" (loud commands) to control hostiles. If engaged, utilize "suppressive fire" to neutralize threats.
   * Extraction: Once the structure is secured, conduct a "rapid extraction" (exfil) of Carlos to a designated "rally point" (RP).
   * Contingencies: Prepare for "IEDs" (improvised explosive devices), "entrenched positions," and "unexpected enemy reinforcements."
Scenario 2: High-Value Target Elimination (Carlos is a Threat)
 * Situation: "Carlos," a known threat, is located inside a fortified residential structure.
 * Mission: Eliminate Carlos with precision and minimal collateral damage.
 * Tactical Plan (Military Lingo):
   * Target Acquisition: Utilize "ISR" (intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance) assets to confirm Carlos's location and movements within the structure.
   * Sniper Overwatch: Establish a "sniper overwatch" position with a clear line of sight to the target area.
   * Breach and Assault: If a direct sniper shot is not feasible, conduct a "deliberate breach" (controlled entry) and assault on the structure.
   * Close Quarters Battle (CQB): Employ CQB tactics to clear rooms and engage Carlos. Utilize "flashbangs" (stun grenades) and "breaching charges" as needed.
   * Positive Identification (PID): Ensure positive identification of Carlos before engaging.
   * After Action Report (AAR): After the mission, conduct an AAR to analyze the operation and identify areas for improvement.
Scenario 3: Site Exploitation (Carlos's Intel is the Target)
 * Situation: "Carlos" has left a residential structure, but valuable intelligence is believed to remain inside.
 * Mission: Secure the structure and conduct a thorough "site exploitation" (search and seize) to recover the intelligence.
 * Tactical Plan (Military Lingo):
   * Secure Perimeter: Establish a secure perimeter around the structure to prevent unauthorized access.
   * Systematic Search: Conduct a systematic search of the structure, utilizing "grid search" patterns and "evidence collection" procedures.
   * Electronic Warfare (EW): Utilize EW equipment to detect and neutralize any electronic threats or surveillance devices.
   * Document Exploitation (DOCEX): Collect and analyze any documents, electronic devices, or other potential sources of intelligence.
   * Forensic Analysis: If necessary, conduct forensic analysis of collected evidence to extract further intelligence.
   * Exfil with Assets: Safely exfil all recovered assets to a secure location.
Key Military Lingo:
 * EES: Estimated Enemy Strength
 * EP: Entry Point
 * Recon: Reconnaissance
 * ISR: Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance
 * CQB: Close Quarters Battle
 * PID: Positive Identification
 * AAR: After Action Report
 * IED: Improvised Explosive Device
 * RP: Rally Point
 * Exfil: Extraction
 * DOCEX: Document Exploitation.
Remember, safety is paramount. When role-playing, ensure you are in a safe environment and avoid any actions that could cause harm.
