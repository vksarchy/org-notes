[[element vs station]]


In infantry and radio comms, **"element"** refers to a specific unit or sub-unit within a larger force. It’s used when addressing or referencing a distinct group without naming individuals.

### **When to Use "Element":**

1. **Coordinating Maneuvers:**
    
    - _"Lead element, push to the objective."_
    - Used when directing a specific portion of a unit.
2. **Situational Reports (SITREPs):**
    
    - _"Enemy contact, left element suppressed."_
    - Specifies which part of your force is engaged.
3. **Radio Communications:**
    
    - _"Second element, hold position. First element, breach."_
    - Keeps instructions clear when multiple groups are operating.
4. **Fire Support Requests:**
    
    - _"Element in contact, requesting suppressive fire."_
    - Clarifies which group needs assistance.
5. **Deconfliction:**
    
    - _"Friendly element moving through your sector."_
    - Prevents fratricide when working with multiple teams.

### **Why Not Just Say "Squad" or "Team"?**

- "Element" is **more flexible**—it can refer to a fireteam, squad, platoon, or even a specialized detachment.
- Avoids confusion when working with mixed or ad-hoc units.
- Keeps radio traffic concise.
