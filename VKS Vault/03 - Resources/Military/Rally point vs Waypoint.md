Negative. Rally Point (RP) and Waypoint (WP) are distinct terms in military lingo.

Rally Point (RP): A predesignated location where units regroup, reorganize, or await further orders. Used for contingencies (e.g., if a unit gets separated or needs to reset before an assault).

Waypoint (WP): A navigation marker along a planned route, used to guide movement from one point to another. Common in land navigation and aviation.


RP is about people regrouping, WP is about navigational progress.
