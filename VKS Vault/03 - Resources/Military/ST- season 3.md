I got to call an audible, keep the aft team with us
(In the military, saying **"I got an audible"** can mean that a **last-minute change of plans or orders** has been made. It comes from American football, where a quarterback calls an "audible" at the line of scrimmage to change the play based on what they see from the defense.

**Military Use of "Audible"**

- It usually means a **sudden change in mission, tactics, or movement** based on new intel or battlefield conditions.
- Can apply to **combat scenarios, training exercises, or logistics** (like a shift in deployment plans).
- Often used in **Special Operations** where adaptability is key.

**Examples in Context**

✅ **Radio Comms:** “Bravo team, I got an audible—changing the infil route. Stand by for new grid coordinates.”
✅ **Mission Planning:** “We were set to hit the target at 0300, but intel says HVT moved. We got an audible—new time is 0200.”
✅ **Logistics:** “Squad was supposed to exfil by air, but weather shut it down. Audible—going by ground.”

It basically means **“adjust on the fly”** based on real-time changes.)
