# Using the Bathroom / Shower 

Tactically, you'd want to keep it short, clear, and mission-oriented. Here are some ways to say it:

1. **Basic Tactical Comms:**
    
    - _"Stepping off for personal maintenance. Back in [X] mikes. Out."_
    - _"Off-station for hygiene. Will reestablish comms in [X] mikes. Over."_
2. **More Casual, But Still Tactical:**
    
    - _"Breaking for hygiene. Will RTB shortly. Out."_ (RTB = Return to Base)
    - _"Off comms for maintenance. Expect me back in [X]."_
3. **If You Want to Sound Cool & Cryptic:**
    
    - _"Conducting field decon. Resuming ops in [X] mikes."_
    - _"Going black for hygiene. Will re-engage shortly. Out."_

How do you want to roll with it, Bravo 1?
