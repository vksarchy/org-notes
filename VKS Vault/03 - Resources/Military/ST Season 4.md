We're rolling out or not, the ops tonight right?

Three foot world
In the series SEAL Team, the term *"3-foot world"* is frequently used by the characters, particularly Jason Hayes (played by David Boreanaz). It refers to a mindset or philosophy that emphasizes focusing on what is immediately within your control—essentially, the three feet around you. This concept is about staying present, managing the immediate task at hand, and not getting overwhelmed by the bigger picture or things outside your control.

For the Tier 1 operators in the show, this mindset is crucial during high-stakes missions. It helps them stay focused, make quick decisions, and maintain their composure in life-or-death situations. The idea is to concentrate on the immediate environment, the mission objective, and the team, rather than getting distracted by external factors or long-term concerns.

This concept is also reflective of real-life military and special operations training, where staying focused on the immediate task is critical for success and survival.
