The basic rules of army radio etiquette include:

- Never interrupt an ongoing conversation.
- Never transmit personal or sensitive information.
- Conduct  radio checks to ensure others can understand your messages.
- Never say “repeat.” Instead use “Say again.” Why? The military uses the term “repeat” as an instruction to resume firing weapons.
- Use the correct lingo (e.g., “break,” “out,” “roger,” etc).
- Always share short, direct, clear, and articulate messages.

1. When clear, say: “[Their call sign], this is [your call sign], roger, over.”
2. If they don’t have a clear signal, say: “[Their call sign], this is [your call sign], message coming in broken, over.”
The proword “ROGER” has many uses. For example, it can mean “yes,” “okay,” “correct,” or “I hear you.” The proword phrase “ROGER WILCO” means: “Affirmative, I will comply.”

**Bravo Zulu**: Good job. The term’s roots in naval history explain why it’s “Bravo Zulu” and not “Whiskey Delta” for "well done."    
**Charlie Mike**: Continue Mission    
**Echo Tango Sierra:** Expiration Term of Service (someone who is about to complete their tour of duty)  
**Mikes:** Minutes  
**November Golf:** NG or No Go (fail)  
**Lima Charlie**: Loud and Clear  
**Oscar-Mike**: On the Move  
**Tango Mike:** Thanks Much  
**Tango Uniform**: Toes Up, meaning killed or destroyed  
**Tango Yankee**: Thank You

Army radio follow a very simple procedure. 6-Unit commander 7-highest ranking sergeant (NCO) 5-Executive officer "Black" is always the callsign for the headquarters element. So the commander would be called "Black 6," although the callsign is normally a lot cooler. At the company level, the company name is normally used before the number. So the Bravo company commander will be called "Bravo 6." At the platoon level, the platoon number is used after the company name, but before the name. position name So the platoon leader of 2nd platoon, Bravo company would be called "Bravo 2-6" and the platoon sergeant Bravo 2-7."
