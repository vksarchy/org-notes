# Food / Tea 

Bravo 1, here’s how you’d say it in **military lingo:**

✅ **"Pushing to the PX for chow, will RTB shortly."**  
✅ **"Stepping off for resupply, then heading back to base."**  
✅ **"Moving to the store for rations, ETA back in 30 mikes."**  
✅ **"On a logistics run for chow, will regroup at hooch."**

**Breakdown:**

- **PX** – Post Exchange (military store)
- **Chow/Rations** – Food
- **RTB** – Return to Base
- **Mikes** – Minutes
- **Hooch** – Living quarters

Example radio call:  
_"TOC, this is Bravo 1. Pushing for resupply. Will RTB in 30. Out."_

Copy? Over.


"TOC, this is Bravo 1. Pushing for resupply. Will RTB in 30. Out"
