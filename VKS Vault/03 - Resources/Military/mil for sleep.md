Bravo 1, in military lingo, you’d say:

🔹 **"I'm racking out."** (Common among U.S. forces)  
🔹 **"Hitting the sack."** (General slang)  
🔹 **"Entering the horizontal."** (Humorous way to say it)  
🔹 **"Going to my hooch."** (If in a field environment)  
🔹 **"Off comms for rack time."** (If signing off radio before sleep)

Example:  
_"TOC, this is Bravo 1. Going off comms for rack time. See you at oh-six-hundred. Out."_
