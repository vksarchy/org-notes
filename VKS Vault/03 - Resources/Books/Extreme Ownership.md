# Extreme Ownership - Jenki 


QRF - Quick Response Force
APC - Armored Personnel Carrier

“You can’t make people listen to you. You can’t make them execute. That might be a temporary solution for a simple task. But to implement real change, to drive people to accomplish something truly complex or difficult or dangerous—you can’t make people do those things. You have to lead them.”

Field of fire
Thought through all the possibilities 
infallible - incapable

> [!NOTE]
>> “How can you best get your team to most effectively execute the plan in order to accomplish the mission?”

Now, compare that to the commander who came in and took the blame. He said, ‘My subordinate leaders made bad calls; I must not have explained the overall intent well enough.’ Or, ‘The assault force didn’t execute the way I envisioned; I need to make sure they better understand my intent and rehearse more thoroughly.’

IBS - Inflatable Boat, small 

Success resulted from determination and will, but also from innovation and communication with the team. Such training graduated men who were not only physically tough but who could also out-think their adversary.


> [!NOTE]
> Leaders should never be satisfied. They must always strive to improve, and they must build that mind-set into the team.

Tortured Genius 
- a Tortured Genius, in this sense, accepts zero responsibility for mistakes, makes excuses, and blames everyone else for their failings (and those of their team). In their mind, the rest of the world just can’t see or appreciate the genius in what they are doing. An individual with a Tortured Genius mind-set can have catastrophic impact on a team’s performance.

> [!NOTE]
> when it comes to performance standards, It’s not what you preach, it’s what you tolerate.



# Pressure under Chaos
Never back down on your decision even under extreme pressure under chaos
Leaders should develup this 

# Extreme Discipline 
[[Discipline]]
It all comes to intrinsic discipline, a matter of personal will 
The best SEALs I worked with were invariably the most disciplined. They woke up early. They worked out every day. They studied tactics and technology. They practiced their craft. Some of them even went out on the town, drank, and stayed out until the early hours of the morning. But they still woke up early and maintained discipline at every level 

> [!Note]
> Discipline equals freedom 

The temptation to take the easy road is always there 
Although discipline demands control and [[Asceticism]] , it actually results in freedom 


The more disciplined standard operating procedures (SOPs) a team employs, the more freedom they have to practice Decentralized Command (chapter 8) and thus they can execute faster, sharper, and more efficiently. Just as an individual excels when he or she exercises self-discipline, a unit that has tighter and more-disciplined procedures and processes will excel and win.

Discipline - Strict order, regime and control 
Even though some argue that discipline and freedom are two opposing forces , it is clear that Discipline is the pathway to freedom 

Confidence is contagious 
A good leader must be attentive to details but not get obsessed by them 

i don't mind the risk, but this simply doesn't make any sense 
what if some other unforseen event comes up?

## Prioritize and Execute (Chap 7)

We had stirred up a hornet’s nest, but it was exactly where we wanted to be. Our plan: go where the bad guys would least expect us in order to seriously disrupt their program, kill as many enemy fighters as we could, and decrease their ability to attack nearby U.S. Army and Marine combat outposts. We wanted the enemy to know that they no longer could enjoy safe haven here. This neighborhood was no longer theirs. We owned this ground.
