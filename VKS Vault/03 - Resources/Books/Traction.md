The good news is that you can survive hitting the ceiling by choosing a leadership team that possesses five core leadership abilities. Above all else, your leaders need to be able to ==simplify, delegate, predict, systemize, and structure.== 

* Simple
Keep it Simple, stupid. 
Less is more. 
Visuals, pictures, checklist, acronyms models. 

* Delegate & Elevate.

You’ll have to delegate some of your responsibilities and elevate yourself to operate at your highest level. 

* Predict
Long term & Short term predict 
Min from 90 days, 1 yrs, 10 yrs...

> [!NOTE]
> Long-term predicting is not really about foretelling what will happen; it’s making a decision about what you will do tomorrow based on what you know today.

* Systemize 
Use 1 EOS 
* Structure
Structure things for everything. 

The late Dr. David Viscott, author of _Risking_, wrote, “If you cannot risk, you cannot grow. If you cannot grow, you cannot become your best. If you cannot become your best, you cannot be happy. If you cannot be happy, what else matters?”`

### V/TO Chart
You*2, Prince tells us that to focus on the ends and not on the means. 

> [!NOTE]
> “It is crucial to have a crystal clear picture of where you want to accomplish. Rivet your attention on that spot where you want to land at the end of the quantum leap.Once you do that, it’s almost as if you magnetize yourself to the ways and means involved in the methodology for getting there. Solutions begin to appear. Answers come to you.”


Understand your clints: 

Where are they? Demographic characters 
What are they ? 
- If b2b - then company size, title, type, size, sector 
- If b2c - then age, sex, income, profession. 
Psychographic characters - How do they think? What do they appreciate? What do they need? 

Differentiators, Value Proposition: 

If you believe your 3 uniques and that they matter to your ideal customers, then you should never apologize for them.
