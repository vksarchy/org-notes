**Key Takeaways from the Article:**

- **Build-to-Rent (BTR) Model:** BTR is designed for people who want premium accommodation but can’t afford to buy a home of desired quality. Developers build and manage properties intended for long-term rentals, offering high-grade spaces and attractive amenities.
- **Cost Transparency:** BTR properties feature predictable and transparent pricing, eliminating hidden costs and fees for tenants.
- **Financial Comparison:** Buying a 2 BHK in a metro like Chennai costs ₹80–90 lakh plus loan and fees. For a 20-year home loan of ₹80 lakh at 7%, the 5-year EMI total is ₹37.2 lakh; maintenance adds about ₹3 lakh. Total acquisition over five years is approximately ₹120.2 lakh.
- **BTR Costs:** Renting a comparable BTR unit for five years requires an advance deposit (~₹60,000), monthly rent(~₹30,000), and utilities. Total five-year rent: ₹18 lakh; combined rent plus deposit: ₹18.6 lakh.
- **Purpose-built Communities:** BTR focuses on long-term leases, family-friendly amenities, privacy, and a homely environment. These communities typically experience lower tenant churn and offer stable rental income.
- **Ownership vs. Flexibility:** While buying is a smart long-term investment, BTR is suitable for those seeking quality living and amenities without the financial burden of homeownership, offering flexibility and affordability with professional management.[1]
