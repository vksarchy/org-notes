Q: sadhguru says look at things for the way they are, and stop thinking.  
If you want to think , think consciously.  
Dive deep into this for i find it vague.  
Help me to understand this so that i can implement it in my daily life.

Ah, classic Sadhguru—cryptic, poetic, and half the time sounds like he’s handing you a riddle instead of an instruction manual. But there’s practical depth in his words, once you boil the mysticism off.

Let’s unpack it line by line:

---

### 🔹 **"Look at things for the way they are, and stop thinking."**

This isn’t saying "become a vegetable." It’s about **perception without mental commentary.** Here’s what’s really meant:

- When you see a tree, just _see_ the tree.
    
- Don’t say, “Oh, this tree reminds me of my school days... or it looks sad… or I wonder how tall it is…”
    

That extra narration is **unconscious thinking.** You're not in the moment—you’re trapped in your mind’s backlog or projections.

#### 🔧 Daily Implementation:

- When you’re walking, just _walk_. Be aware of your body, sounds, light, textures.
    
- If someone’s speaking, **just listen**, without prepping your response or judging what they say.

### 🔹 **"If you want to think, think consciously."**

Here, he's not anti-thinking. He’s anti-**mindless rumination**. Conscious thought is:

- Directed.
    
- Voluntary.
    
- Useful.
    

Unconscious thought is:

- Repetitive.
    
- Reactionary.
    
- Draining.
    

You use your **mind like a tool**, not let it use you.

#### 🔧 Daily Implementation:

- Schedule thinking. For example: “At 8PM, I’ll sit down and plan tomorrow.”
    
- When thoughts come up at odd times (like regret, worry), **label them**:  
    → "Ah, that’s planning"  
    → "That’s fear"  
    → "That’s memory"  
    Then gently return to the present.

### 🔍 The Underlying Principle:

Sadhguru is pointing to **awareness as the baseline**, and **thought as a tool**.

Most people run on auto-thought:

- “What if this happens?”
    
- “Did I screw that up?”
    
- “Why did they say that to me?”
    

He's saying: **Turn off autopilot.** Observe without narrating. Think only when needed, like picking up a hammer only when you have a nail.
