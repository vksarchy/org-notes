The conflicts involving Iran, Israel, and Iraq are complex and multifaceted, spanning several decades and involving various geopolitical dynamics.

### Iran-Iraq Conflict (1980-1988)
The primary conflict between Iran and Iraq was the Iran-Iraq War, which lasted from September 1980 to August 1988.

- **Causes**: The war was sparked by territorial disputes, particularly over the Shatt al-Arab waterway, and Iraq's desire to seize the oil-rich Khuzestan province in Iran. Iraq, under Saddam Hussein, also sought to exploit the post-revolutionary chaos in Iran following the 1979 Islamic Revolution[1][3][5].
- **Course of the War**: Iraq invaded Iran on September 22, 1980, but faced strong resistance from Iranian forces. The war turned into a bloody stalemate characterized by trench warfare, human wave attacks, and the use of chemical weapons by Iraq. Despite several attempts at peace, the war continued until a UN-mediated cease-fire was accepted by Iran in 1988[1][2][5].
- **Aftermath**: The war resulted in significant casualties (estimates range from one to two million) and economic damage for both countries. Normal diplomatic relations were resumed in August 1990, with the withdrawal of troops and the exchange of prisoners of war[1][3][5].

### Iran-Israel Conflict
The conflict between Iran and Israel is more recent and ongoing.

- **Historical Context**: Despite their current animosity, Israel and Iran had a secretive partnership during the Iran-Iraq War. Israel provided military support to Iran to counter the common threat posed by Iraq, including the sale of military equipment and the bombing of Iraq's Osirak nuclear reactor[6].
- **Current Tensions**: The relationship deteriorated significantly after the 1979 Iranian Revolution and the rise of anti-Israel rhetoric from Iranian leaders. Today, Iran and Israel are adversaries, with Iran supporting groups like Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza, which are opposed by Israel. Israel has conducted airstrikes against Iranian targets and allies in Syria and has been involved in covert operations against Iranian nuclear programs[4][6][7].
- **Recent Escalations**: Tensions have escalated with Iran launching missile attacks on Israel in response to Israeli actions against Iranian allies and targets. This has led to a cycle of retaliation and counter-retaliation, with international concerns about the potential for a wider regional conflict[7][8].

### Iraq's Role in Current Conflicts
Iraq is currently caught in the midst of the broader regional conflicts involving Iran and Israel.

- **Proxy Conflicts**: Iraq is a battleground for proxy conflicts between the U.S. and Iran, with Iranian-backed paramilitaries operating in Iraq and targeting U.S. forces. This dynamic complicates Iraq's foreign policy and domestic stability[8].
- **Alignment with Iran**: Some Iraqi political parties and armed groups have close ties with Iran, which influences Iraq's stance on regional issues, including the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. However, Iraq also values its relationship with the U.S. for security assistance and as a balance against Iranian influence[8].

In summary, the conflicts involve historical territorial and ideological disputes between Iran and Iraq, and a more recent and ongoing geopolitical rivalry between Iran and Israel, with Iraq often being a focal point of these broader regional tensions.
