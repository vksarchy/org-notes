Tywin Lannister’s mind is a machine built for **power, control, and legacy.** He does not waste time on emotions or distractions—his thoughts are always strategic. The questions he asks himself reflect this mindset.

---

### **1. "Who controls this situation?"**

- **If it is not me, why not?**
- **Who is truly in charge, and how do I take their position?**
- **If I cannot control it directly, how do I control the person who does?**

> **Tywin’s Rule:** _Power is not held by the strongest, but by the one who decides the outcome._

---

### **2. "What does this person fear?"**

- **What is their weakness—loss of status, failure, physical harm, family?**
- **How do I exploit this fear to make them act in my interest?**
- **If they fear nothing, how do I make them fear me?**

> **Tywin’s Rule:** _A man’s true loyalty is not to his friends, but to what he fears most._

---

### **3. "What is the long-term consequence of this action?"**

- **Will this decision give me power not just today, but years from now?**
- **Does this strengthen my legacy, or does it weaken my house?**
- **If I kill a man today, will his son be a threat tomorrow?**

> **Tywin’s Rule:** _A fool thinks of victory. A ruler thinks of generations._

---

### **4. "Who benefits most from this?"**

- **If I do nothing, who gains power?**
- **If I intervene, can I shift the outcome in my favor?**
- **Am I being used as a pawn in someone else’s game?**

> **Tywin’s Rule:** _Never be a tool in another man’s ambition—make him a tool in yours._

---

### **5. "What is the perception of power here?"**

- **Do I appear strong, or do I appear weak?**
- **If I act, does it enhance my reputation or diminish it?**
- **Is fear working in my favor, or must I reinforce it?**

> **Tywin’s Rule:** _Power is not just what you have—it is what others believe you have._

---

### **6. "What happens if I do nothing?"**

- **Does my inaction give others an advantage?**
- **Does it force my enemies to expose themselves?**
- **Do I gain more by waiting than by acting now?**

> **Tywin’s Rule:** _A rash man wins battles. A patient man wins wars._

---

### **7. "Who is useful, and who is expendable?"**

- **Who brings value to my cause?**
- **Who is a liability, and when do I cut them loose?**
- **Who believes they are irreplaceable, and how do I prove them wrong?**

> **Tywin’s Rule:** _Loyalty is useful, but it is not an excuse for incompetence._

---

### **8. "Where is the real threat?"**

- **Is my enemy in front of me, or is there a greater danger behind me?**
- **Is the visible problem the real problem, or is someone manipulating events?**
- **Who gains the most from my focus being here?**

> **Tywin’s Rule:** _The most dangerous enemy is the one you do not see—until it is too late._

---

### **9. "How do I ensure this never happens again?"**

- **If a mistake was made, how do I eliminate the possibility of it recurring?**
- **If a rebellion started, do I simply crush it, or do I destroy the _idea_ of rebellion?**
- **If I was outmaneuvered, how do I make sure I am never in this position again?**

> **Tywin’s Rule:** _A man who learns from a mistake will never make it twice. A man who does not will not live long enough to._

---

### **10. "What will they say of me when I am gone?"**

- **Will my name command respect beyond my lifetime?**
- **Will my descendants fear and honor my legacy?**
- **Have I built something that lasts?**

> **Tywin’s Rule:** _A great man’s story does not end when he dies. It becomes legend._
