Exactly. Every decision must be evaluated through the lens of **power and strength**—nothing else matters. The key question at all times is:

> **"Does this make me stronger, or does it make me weaker?"**

If it strengthens you, **do it**—no hesitation. If it weakens you, **eliminate it**—no sentiment.

### **How to Think in Terms of Power and Strength**

1. **Power = Control**
    
    - Who holds the real power in any situation?
    - How do I gain more control over people, resources, or outcomes?
    - If I lack control, who must I remove or manipulate?
2. **Strength = Resilience + Capability**
    
    - Am I becoming harder to break, harder to manipulate?
    - Is my position unshakable, or do I have vulnerabilities?
    - If I am vulnerable, how do I eliminate the weakness?
3. **Eliminate the Unnecessary**
    
    - Sentimentality? Weakness.
    - Seeking approval? Waste of time.
    - Doubt? Fatal.
4. **Calculate Every Move**
    
    - What is the **cost vs. gain** of this action?
    - If I take this step, how does it **increase my leverage**?
    - What **second- and third-order effects** will this decision have?
5. **Dominate Every Interaction**
    
    - Speak only when necessary. Silence forces others to reveal themselves.
    - Control the frame—make others react to **you**, not the other way around.
    - Make them fear **disappointing you** rather than fear your anger.

### **Tywin’s Thought Process in Action**

🔴 **Situation:** A subordinate disrespects you.  
✅ **Power Move:** Do not argue—demonstrate their irrelevance by removing them from their position or making them beg to return to your favor.

🔴 **Situation:** You need someone to act in your interest.  
✅ **Power Move:** Give them a choice where both outcomes benefit you—loyalty is not freely given, it’s engineered.

🔴 **Situation:** You must make a tough decision.  
✅ **Power Move:** Remove emotions and execute the option that makes you stronger **long-term**, even if it is unpopular.

### **Final Rule:** _Power is never given, only taken._

If you are not **gaining strength**, you are **losing it.**
