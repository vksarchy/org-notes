Here is a **Markdown table** listing the **top 10 specialty chemicals exported and imported by India** (as of 2025). The list is specific and focuses on widely traded specialty chemical products or intermediates, rather than generic categories:

|Rank|Exported Specialty Chemicals (from India)|Imported Specialty Chemicals (to India)|
|---|---|---|
|1|Dyestuffs & Pigments (e.g. Reactive, Acid dyes)|Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs)|
|2|Agrochemical Intermediates/Herbicides|Methanol|
|3|Aroma Chemicals (e.g. Citral, Menthol, Linalool)|Acetic Acid|
|4|Fluoro-specialty Chemicals (e.g. Fluoropolymers)|Maleic Anhydride|
|5|Monomethyl Aniline (MMA)/Metanilic Acid|Phenol|
|6|Personal Care Intermediates (e.g. Surfactants, Emollients)|Sodium Silicate|
|7|Textile Chemical Auxiliaries (e.g. Softeners, Fixers)|Bulk Dyes and Pigments|
|8|Polymer Additives (e.g. Plasticizers, Flame Retardants)|Caustic Soda|
|9|Performance Chemicals (e.g. Lubricant Additives, Water Treatment)|Agrochemical Intermediates|
|10|Pharmaceutical Intermediates (non-API)|Specialty Polymers (e.g. engineering plastics)|

**Note:**

- **Exports**: India is a major global supplier of dyes/pigments, agrochemical intermediates, aroma chemicals, and fluorospecialties. Indian firms lead in custom synthesis, contract manufacturing, and advanced intermediates.
    
- **Imports**: India heavily imports APIs (mainly from China), basic input organic chemicals (like methanol, acetic acid), specialty polymers, and advanced intermediates not available domestically.
