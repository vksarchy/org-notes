That Lankan king declareed war on the Pandyas 
The Cholas , who abducted the child king and declared war, now plotted against the Pandya dutchy 
But since the lankans were also competing for the dutchy , the chola king plotted a murder scheme aganst the Lankna king, to his surprise was joined by his wife, giving him a greaeter success chance. 
Meanwhile the Chola king declared war on the Pandyas, seiged their counties as they were busy figthing in the Lankas, and he enforced the war score on them and won the war. 
but the war of the lankas now became the Chola's war, whom he had executed the murder scheme and they offered white peace.... 
Mind blown by that strategy...

# Learn about vassals

#ChatGPT 
In _Crusader Kings 3_ (CK3), vassals are crucial to managing your realm and expanding your influence. Here’s an overview of vassals, types of vassalages, and tips on managing them effectively:

### **Types of Vassalages**

1. **Feudal Vassals**
    
    - These vassals manage their own territories and pay taxes or provide levies based on their contract.
    - You can modify their obligations (taxes/levies) through hooks or diplomacy.
    - They are common in kingdoms/empires with a feudal government.
2. **Clan Vassals**
    
    - Found in regions with clan-based governments, particularly in the Middle East or North Africa.
    - They provide taxes and levies based on their opinion of you.
    - Maintaining high opinion is crucial to maximizing contributions.
3. **Tribal Vassals**
    
    - Tribal leaders pay taxes and provide levies based on their prestige rather than gold.
    - They are harder to manage if you’re not also tribal.
4. **Special Vassalages**
    
    - **Grand Cities or Republics**: Often have unique obligations, with a focus on taxes rather than levies.
    - **Theocracies**: Controlled by clergy and often contribute based on religious alignment.

---

### **Managing Vassals**

1. **Keep Vassals Happy**
    
    - Use diplomacy, bribes, or gifts to improve their opinion.
    - Grant titles or honorary roles like Spymaster or Chancellor to important vassals.
    - Marry into their family for alliances and loyalty.
2. **Prevent Rebellions**
    
    - Watch for factions forming among unhappy vassals.
    - Use hooks to force compliance or adjust contracts.
    - Imprison or weaken potential threats through schemes or war.
3. **Modify Vassal Contracts**
    
    - Use a hook to negotiate more taxes/levies without angering the vassal.
    - Avoid overburdening powerful vassals; they may revolt.
4. **Manage Titles and Succession**
    
    - Avoid granting too many titles to a single vassal; they might grow too strong.
    - Use partition succession laws to split large vassal realms upon their death.

---

### **Gameplay Tips for Vassals**

- **Balance Power**: Keep vassals evenly matched so no single one can threaten your rule.
- **Imprison or Execute Traitors**: Justifiable actions won’t anger your other vassals.
- **Create Loyalists**: Establish a core group of highly loyal vassals who will support you in factions or wars.
- **Use Schemes**: Employ your Spymaster to uncover secrets or fabricate hooks on troublesome vassals.
- **Control Religion and Culture**: Converting vassals to your religion or culture can reduce friction.

# Types of Govt 
## CLAN

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiPbf0I8vtU

Antagonsitic Succession - Gavelkind - All titles will be inherited equally 
harmnious succession - not completely Primogeniture succsession - All children inherit 
While it does give the capitol duchy and associated titles, it only gives 3/4 of other titles. It's still massively superior to other succession forms of the time though!

Vizier - appoint them , then you can stela money from them , mulct vizier - kinda like sharing regent 
balance of power - 3 or 4 level is good 
	you can end your vizierate 
	you can assign mandate to them - filling coffers 
viziers can be minor land holders or landed - if landed they'll use that modifiers to build in thier lands and you can steal from them too 
arbitrary ppl are tough to get on your side, self interested works on swinging the scales of power towards him 

TAX: 
![[Pasted image 20250223234545.png]]
if the vizier swings power between 4 or 5 , you may get another tax collector 
Zakat - for gold 
Iqta - for men at arms 
Ghazi - fighting non muslims 

Innovations : 
Bailifs - Medieval era innovation for taxing from a larger realm 
late medieval - court officials 

Accuse of decadence 
you can form internal alliance from the same dynasty or from your same culture - helps you to increase the house unity 
No alliance as clan vassal - negative 50. , so u wann form many alliances within your clan 

Giving titles to your dynasty : 
give your titles away to your house members who are far off from each other, not  closeby as they will tend to fight and decrease the house unity - you can see the recent house unity changes and monitor it 

Tax collectors are unlanded, the good ones are your brothers and cousins, so make sure to educate them at an early age

20 stewardship - one more extra domain 
Stewardship tree - Golden obligations  
Watch out for control in your Land, need senetchel , military commander to increase control, martial perk to increase control 
watch out for the innovations - barracks eg in tribal era 
construct market or war camps  - in the counties you hold 
first construct markets increase gold income and then construct war camps 
#### most of the vassals give the dutchy in the border as they will go to war then you have to usurp the dutchy from them and grant it.

you can disinherit your sons coz most of the tribal will have confederate partition - all children will inherit equally 
Raid the borders and don't step in too much away from your borders as your attrititon rate will go up 
By raiding you increaes your prestige and gold 
if you're the commander your prestige skyrockets after winningt the battle 
 
long houses, gathering halls , increasing your tribal hold 
palisades, war camps (innovation from barracks) , markets 
![[Pasted image 20250224110341.png]]
Fully upgraded tribal holdings with all the buildings 

After barracks innovation discoverd 
**![[Pasted image 20250224110713.png]]
War camps to Warrior logdes - barracks innovation 

Have a royal architect to decrease the construction time 

![[Pasted image 20250224111140.png|400]]


station besiegers and move forward to take on another 
inorder to regen your men at arms you need to place yourself on the land captured
