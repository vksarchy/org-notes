Alright, Bravo 1 — straight and sharp.

### GI Tag = **Geographical Indication Tag**

- It’s like a trademark for a **region’s product**.
    
- Given by the **Government of India** under the **GI of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999**.
    
- Ensures only products actually originating from that region can use the name.
    
- Protects **cultural identity + prevents misuse**.
    
- Example: **Madurai Malli (Jasmine)** has a GI tag → only jasmine grown in Madurai district can be marketed as _Madurai Malli_.
