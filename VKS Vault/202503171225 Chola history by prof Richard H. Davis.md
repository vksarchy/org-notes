# Raja Raja Chola: A Complete Timeline of the Chola Empire's Great Ruler

The remarkable story of Raja Raja Chola represents one of South India's most significant imperial formations. Professor Richard H. Davis' lecture provides a comprehensive timeline of this medieval Tamil king who transformed a regional kingdom into India's most powerful empire of its time. Below is a detailed chronological examination of Raja Raja's life, reign, and legacy.

## The Early Chola Kingdom (850-947 CE)

The foundation of the Chola dynasty that Raja Raja would eventually lead began in 850 CE when a ruler named Vijaya seized the fort at Tanjavur. This marked the beginning of what historians call the "medieval" or "imperial" Chola period1. Upon establishing control, Vijaya built a shrine dedicated to the goddess Nishumba Sudini, a fierce form of the great goddess, establishing religious patronage as a key aspect of Chola rulership1.

Over the next century, this small kingdom expanded, particularly during the reign of Parantaka I (referred to as Paranakawan in the lecture), who was Raja Raja's great-grandfather1. This territorial growth positioned the Cholas as emerging powers in South India, but also placed them in conflict with larger imperial entities.

## The Rashtrakuta Conflict and Political Instability

By the mid-10th century, the expanding Chola kingdom began to pose a threat to the larger imperial state to its north — the Rashtrakuta Empire based in the Deccan1. This tension would have significant consequences for the young Chola prince:

- **947 CE**: Arumoli Deva (the future Raja Raja Chola) was born into the Chola royal family1
    
- **949 CE**: When Arumoli was just a toddler, the Rashtrakuta king Krishna III attacked the Cholas at Takolam in northern Tamil Nadu and decisively defeated them1
    

Following this defeat, the Rashtrakutas occupied northern portions of Tamil Nadu for approximately two decades. The Cholas entered a period of political weakness and dynastic confusion1. During Arumoli's youth, several members of his extended royal family had short, truncated, and overlapping reigns, including both his grandfather Arinaya and his father Sundara Chola1.

## The Reign of Uttama Chola (973-985 CE)

The political environment stabilized somewhat when Arumoli's uncle ascended to power:

- **973 CE**: Arumoli's uncle Uttama Chola (referred to as Utamat Chola in the lecture) assumed the throne1
    
- Uttama Chola had a peaceful reign of 12 years during which the Chola Kingdom recovered control over its core regions along the Kaveri River and reestablished stability1
    

During this period, an important cultural and religious development occurred under the patronage of a royal woman:

- Sembiyan Mahadevi (referred to as Sembian Maavi), the mother of Uttama Chola, began an extensive program of royal patronage, rebuilding numerous older brick temples in stone1
    
- She promoted the image of Shiva Nataraja both in bronze icons for processions and on the outer walls of the temples she commissioned1
    
- This religious patronage established important precedents that Raja Raja would later expand to imperial proportions
    

## Raja Raja's Reign (985-1014 CE)

When Arumoli Deva finally ascended to the throne, he was already a mature ruler with considerable experience:

- **985 CE**: Arumoli Deva assumed the Chola throne at approximately 38 years of age, having gained experience as Yuvaraja (crown prince) under Uttama Chola1
    
- Almost immediately, he began aggressive military campaigns to expand the Chola kingdom in every direction1
    
- **988 CE** (third year of his reign): He adopted the royal title "Raja Raja" by which he is now known in history1
    
- **992 CE** (seventh year of his reign): He instituted a formal practice of including a Tamil praise poem called a "meerti" or "true fame" with all inscriptions issued in his name1
    

This meerti poem listed his conquests in verse form, proclaiming: "The goddess of the great earth as well as Lakshmi goddess of prosperity took him alone as their rightful husband. He broke up the vessel at the hall of Kandalure with his powerful victorious army. He conquered the Vengai territory, land of the Gangas, the Tadaigai and the Nolumbas, the Kudamalai territory, Kolum, Kolinga, the lands of Lanka which made him famous in the eight directions, and the seven and a half locks of the Rashtrakuta territory. He took away the splendor of the Pandas so that he was worthy to be worshipped everywhere."1

## Temple Building and Imperial Representation

Raja Raja's most enduring legacy was his construction of the massive imperial temple at Tanjavur, but this came only after he had established his military dominance:

- Early in his reign, Raja Raja did not personally engage in temple construction, leaving that activity to Sembiyan Mahadevi and various local officials1
    
- **Around 1000 CE** (15th year of his reign): After conducting successful military campaigns, Raja Raja and his court officials began planning an imperial temple to Shiva in Tanjavur1
    
- **1005 CE**: The foundations of the temple were completed, and the principal Shivalinga, called Raja Rajeshwara ("the Lord of Raja Raja"), was installed1
    
- **1010 CE** (Raja Raja's 25th regnal year): The king presented a gold-plated finial for the summit of the temple tower, and the temple was consecrated with an inaugural Abhisheka ceremony1
    
- **1011 CE**: Raja Raja established the policy of recording on the stone walls of the temple all donations made by him and his family1
    

The temple, now known simply as Brihadeshwara or "the Big Temple," was unprecedented in scale—approximately five times larger than any previous Chola temple1. It required immense resources, including an estimated 49,000 cubic meters of granite that had to be transported from at least 30 miles away1.

## Death and Succession (1014-1024 CE)

- **1014 CE**: Raja Raja died at the age of 67, before the temple was fully completed1
    
- Construction of the temple continued for a few years after his death but was eventually left unfinished1
    

His son Rajendra Chola continued and expanded his father's imperial ambitions:

- Rajendra carried out even more far-reaching military campaigns than his father1
    
- **1024 CE**: Rajendra's army reached the Ganges River in North India1
    
- After this northern conquest, Rajendra began constructing a new capital called Gangai Chola Puram ("the city of the Chola king who took the Ganges")1
    
- Rather than completing his father's temple, Rajendra used resources to build a new imperial Shiva temple at his new capital1
    

## Historical Legacy and Modern Revival

Interestingly, despite his monumental achievements:

- Raja Raja was completely forgotten until the late 19th century when scholars Holtz and Venayak rediscovered him through their translation of the inscriptions at the Big Temple1
    
- The inscriptions were published in 1891 in a 499-page volume titled "South Indian Inscriptions, Volume 2"1
    
- **1984**: A celebration marked the 1,000th anniversary of Raja Raja's accession to the throne, attended by prominent figures including then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi1
    

Today, Raja Raja Chola has been fully reclaimed as a significant historical figure:

- His birthday is celebrated annually in Tanjavur1
    
- His statues are prominently displayed throughout the city1
    
- He became the subject of a recent blockbuster two-part film by director Mani Ratnam1
    

## Conclusion

Raja Raja Chola's timeline reveals how he transformed a regional Tamil kingdom into an imperial power through military conquest, strategic alliances, and monumental architectural projects. His reign (985-1014 CE) represents a pivotal period in South Indian history when the Chola Empire reached unprecedented heights of power and cultural influence. Through the building of the magnificent Brihadeshwara Temple, Raja Raja created a lasting symbol of Chola imperial authority that continues to inspire awe more than a millennium later.

The rediscovery and modern celebration of Raja Raja Chola also reflects contemporary cultural politics in India, particularly the assertion of South Indian historical contributions to the broader narrative of Indian civilization. His legacy thus remains relevant not only for understanding medieval Indian history but also for appreciating the ongoing negotiation of regional and national identities in modern India.

🧠 Beyond the lecture transcript, it's worth noting that Raja Raja's empire would continue to thrive under his successors for nearly two more centuries, making the Cholas one of the longest-lasting and most successful imperial formations in South Asian history.
