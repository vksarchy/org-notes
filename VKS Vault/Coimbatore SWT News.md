Coimbatore has recently undertaken several initiatives to enhance sewage water treatment and address water pollution:

**1. Treated Sewage Water Release into Chinnavedampatti Lake**

The Coimbatore City Municipal Corporation (CCMC) plans to release 19 million liters of treated sewage water daily into Chinnavedampatti Lake. This involves constructing a sewage treatment plant near the lake to process wastewater from areas like Thudiyalur, Vellakinar, and Saravanampatti. While the initiative aims to rejuvenate the lake, environmentalists have expressed concerns about potential ecological impacts. citeturn0search1

**2. Sewage Treatment Plants in Town Panchayats along the Noyyal River**

To combat pollution in the Noyyal River, the National River Conservation Directorate approved the construction of sewage treatment plants in nine town panchayats along the river's course in Coimbatore district. This effort seeks to prevent untreated sewage from contaminating the river, thereby improving water quality and benefiting local communities. citeturn0search6

**3. Community-Level Wastewater Recycling**

A residential complex in Coimbatore, housing 120 families across five blocks, has implemented an on-site sewage treatment plant. This facility processes approximately 80,000 liters of wastewater daily from toilets, kitchens, and bathrooms, addressing discharge challenges and promoting water reuse within the community. citeturn0search5

**4. Ongoing Pollution Challenges in the Noyyal River**

Despite these efforts, the Noyyal River continues to face significant pollution issues, with water quality deteriorating due to industrial and domestic waste discharges. Pollution hotspots include areas like Perur, Alandurai, Puttuvikki Road, and Athupalam, where untreated waste enters the river, underscoring the need for comprehensive waste management strategies. citeturn0search7
