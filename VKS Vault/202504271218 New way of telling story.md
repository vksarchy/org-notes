#Storytelling

Some of my takeaways from the interview: 
1. Every human story revolves around three primal desires: survival (staying alive), connection (belonging to others), and status (being valued in your group). 
2. A character isn't just a collection of traits. They're a walking theory of how the world works — a hypothesis being tested under pressure. 
3. How do you create a character? Start with this simple sentence: "They only feel safe when..." 
4. Alfred Hitchcock once said: "There's no terror in the bang. Only the anticipation of it." 
5. Great stories reveal the gap between how a character thinks the world works and how it actually does. 
6. The slow bits of life should be told fast; the fast bits of life should be told slow. 
7. The extra details people share during a climactic moment mimic the way the brain processes peak moments of stress. Think of the way people describe car crashes. Time slows down. Their sense of detail heightens.
8. When telling a story, you need way less background knowledge than you probably think.
9. Great stories don't just happen as a sequence of events. They're a test of ideas about how the world works. 
10. In tragedies, the hero doesn't transform—they double down on their flawed theory until it destroys them. That's why they end up dead, imprisoned, or alone. 
11. Clear obstacles create clear stories: When you're feeling lost in your story, ask: who wants what, and what's standing in their way? 
12. Or you can do the opposite. You could give a character everything they want: good looks, a big house, lots of money, a successful career, and whatever else they've always wanted. But then you can show how empty they feel in the midst of all this abundance. That's a story worth telling

 who is this person 
 what do they want 
 what is blocking them from getting it
