# THIRUMURAI 
#source 
The **Tirumurai** is a monumental twelve-volume compendium of Shaiva devotional hymns in Tamil, composed between the 6th and 11th centuries CE by a range of poet-saints, most notably the 63 Nayanmars (Nayanars)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirumurai)[2](https://skandagurunatha.com/deities/god-shiva/panniru-thirumurai/). It stands as the foundational scripture of Tamil Shaivism and is revered for both its literary and spiritual value.
## Structure and Authorship

The Tirumurai is divided into twelve books, each with a distinct set of authors and themes:

- **Books 1–3:** Hymns of Sambandar (also known as Thirugnanasambandar), a child saint of the 7th century. He is credited with composing 383 hymns in these volumes (though some editions mention 384), containing 4,181 stanzas[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tevaram)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirumurai).
    
- **Books 4–6:** Hymns of Appar (Thirunavukkarasar), a contemporary of Sambandar, who composed 313 hymns across these books[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirumurai)[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tevaram).
    
- **Book 7:** Hymns of Sundarar (Sundaramurthi), who lived in the 8th century and composed 100 hymns[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirumurai)[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tevaram).
    
- **Book 8:** Works of Manikkavacagar, including _Tiruvasakam_ (659 songs) and _Tirukkovaiyar_ (400 songs), totaling 1,059 hymns[4](http://www.tamilvu.org/courses/diploma/p202/p2021/html/p2021306.htm)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirumurai).
    
- **Book 9:** Hymns by nine other saints, collectively known as _Thiruvisaippa_ and _Thiruppallandu_, with 301 hymns[4](http://www.tamilvu.org/courses/diploma/p202/p2021/html/p2021306.htm)[2](https://skandagurunatha.com/deities/god-shiva/panniru-thirumurai/).
    
- **Book 10:** _Tirumandiram_ by Tirumular, a work of 3,048 verses detailing Saiva Siddhanta philosophy[4](http://www.tamilvu.org/courses/diploma/p202/p2021/html/p2021306.htm)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirumurai).
    
- **Book 11:** Hymns by twelve additional saints (including Nambi Andar Nambi, the compiler), with the number of hymns varying by source. Some sources mention 1430 hymns in the 11th Tirumurai, but this is debated and may refer to verses or include interpolated works[4](http://www.tamilvu.org/courses/diploma/p202/p2021/html/p2021306.htm)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirumurai).
    
- **Book 12:** _Periya Puranam_ by Sekkizhar, a poetic hagiography of the 63 Nayanmars, not a collection of hymns but a single narrative work[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirumurai)[2](https://skandagurunatha.com/deities/god-shiva/panniru-thirumurai/).
    

## Compilation and Significance

The first seven books, collectively known as the **Tevaram** (meaning "garland of divine songs"), contain 796 hymns by Sambandar, Appar, and Sundarar[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tevaram)[4](http://www.tamilvu.org/courses/diploma/p202/p2021/html/p2021306.htm). The hymns are set to traditional Tamil musical modes (_panns_) and are intended to be sung, often with instrumental accompaniment[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tevaram).

The compilation of the Tirumurai was a complex process. It began with the recovery and arrangement of hymns by Nambi Andar Nambi under the patronage of Raja Raja Chola I in the 11th century[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirumurai). The hymns were originally inscribed on palm leaves and later preserved on copper plates and temple inscriptions[4](http://www.tamilvu.org/courses/diploma/p202/p2021/html/p2021306.htm). The inclusion of the _Periya Puranam_ as the twelfth book added a narrative dimension, chronicling the lives of the Nayanmars[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirumurai)[2](https://skandagurunatha.com/deities/god-shiva/panniru-thirumurai/).

> **Note:** The 11th Tirumurai is sometimes cited as containing 1,430 hymns or verses, but this figure may include interpolated works or refer to verses rather than distinct hymns. The 8th Tirumurai's count (1,059) combines two major works by Manikkavacagar.

## Literary and Cultural Impact

The Tirumurai is not only a devotional work but also a literary treasure that shaped Tamil culture, music, and philosophy. Its hymns are still sung in temples, and its stories inspire millions[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirumurai)[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tevaram). The collection represents about 600 years of religious, philosophical, and literary development in Tamil Shaivism[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirumurai).
