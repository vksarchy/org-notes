    - **What to look out for:** Ensure any opioid medication is prescribed by a healthcare professional and used strictly as directed.
3. **Carisoprodol**:
    
    - A muscle relaxant that can be addictive and may cause drowsiness, dizziness, and in combination with opioids, can enhance the risk of severe side effects, including overdose.
    - **What to look out for:** Avoid combining muscle relaxants with other sedatives or opioids unless advised by a doctor.
