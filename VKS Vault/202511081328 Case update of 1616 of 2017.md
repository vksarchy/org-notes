Excellent — you’ve shared two **case status screenshots** from the *eCourts portal* for Coimbatore:

1. **Case 1 – OS No. 190/2017 (CNR: TNCCB08000392017)**

   * **Court:** Principal Sub Court, Coimbatore
   * **Current Judge:** IV Additional Subordinate Judge
   * **Status:** *Ongoing* (last hearing November 2025)
   * **Transfer:** from III Additional Subordinate Judge → IV Additional Subordinate Judge

2. **Case 2 – OS No. 4343/2017 (CNR: TNCB090019442017)**

   * **Court:** Principal District Munsif Court, Coimbatore
   * **Status:** *Disposed on 21st September 2023*
   * **Nature of disposal:** *Uncontested — Dismissed*
   * **Order details:** “Copy of Judgment” and “Copy of Decree” issued

---

### 🧩 Difference between Courts (Upgrade or Downgrade?)

* **District Munsif Court** is a **lower civil court** — it typically handles suits of **lesser pecuniary value** (for example, ₹1 lakh to ₹5 lakh or up to ₹10 lakh depending on state jurisdiction).
* **Subordinate Judge Court (Sub Court)** handles **higher-value or more complex civil suits** — above the pecuniary limits of Munsif Court.

So, when your case moved from **Principal District Munsif Court** to the **Additional Subordinate Judge Court**, it’s an **upgrade** in hierarchy, not a downgrade.
It indicates that either:

* The **value of the suit or property** exceeded the Munsif Court’s jurisdictional limit, **or**
* The matter was **transferred for consolidation** or **administrative reasons** (for example, clubbing related suits).

### ⚖️ What Happened in Each Case

#### **Case 1 – OS No. 190/2017 (Principal Sub Court, Coimbatore)**

* **Filed:** 16 October 2017
* **Nature:** Original Suit (Title) — i.e., ownership or property-related dispute.
* **Multiple Hearings:** From 2017 to 2025, with phases like *Service Pending → Enquiry → Evidence → Trial*.
* **Recent Status:** “Evidence” stage, showing the case is active.
* **Interim Orders:**

  * *12-05-2023*: “Copy of Deposition”
  * *02-10-2023*: “Copy of Deposition”
    Suggests witnesses have been examined.
* **Transfer Note:** Case was moved **from III Additional Sub Judge to IV Additional Sub Judge** (administrative transfer — same level).

🟢 **Meaning:**
This is your *active property/title suit*, progressing through the evidence phase. It has not been dismissed or decreed yet.

#### **Case 2 – OS No. 4343/2017 (Principal District Munsif Court, Coimbatore)**

* **Filed:** 10 October 2017
* **Disposed:** 21 September 2023
* **Nature:** Title suit under Section 151, Civil Procedure Code.
* **Progress:**

  * *2017–2019:* Service pending and ex-parte evidence.
  * *2020–2022:* IA/CMP/CRP/CMA pending (interim petitions).
  * *2023:* Case went into “Trial” and finally *Disposed (Uncontested–Dismissed)*.
* **Outcome:** The suit ended *without contest*, meaning the plaintiff (most likely you or your predecessor) **did not actively pursue it or appear**, leading to **dismissal**.

🟥 **Meaning:**
This earlier case — possibly a **related or smaller claim on the same property** — was *dismissed for non-prosecution or uncontested*, hence legally closed.

### 🧠 Summary (in plain terms)

You originally had two related civil title suits filed in 2017:

* One in **Munsif Court** — which got **dismissed in 2023**.
* Another in **Sub Court** — which is **still ongoing** and is now before the **IV Additional Subordinate Judge**.

Moving from **3rd District Munsif** to **4th Additional Sub Judge** is **an upgrade**, not a downgrade.
It means the case now sits in a **higher civil court** with **broader jurisdiction and authority** to handle complex or higher-value property disputes.
