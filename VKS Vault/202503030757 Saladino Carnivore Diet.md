Paul Saladino, also known for promoting the "Carnivore Diet" (which focuses on eating only animal-based foods), would typically suggest a high-protein, high-fat, and low-carb eating plan. If you’re in India and want to follow his approach to diet while incorporating local ingredients, it’s entirely possible to adapt the diet.

Here's a sample Paul Saladino-inspired diet plan for a guy living in India, with local food options:

### **Morning (Breakfast):**

- **Bone Broth**: Start with a warm cup of bone broth (if available locally) or a homemade stock made from beef, chicken, or mutton bones.
- **Eggs**: Scrambled or fried eggs in ghee (clarified butter) or butter.
- **Liver**: You can try adding organ meats like chicken liver or goat liver, which are commonly available in India.
- **Full-fat yogurt** (optional if tolerating dairy): A small bowl of full-fat, plain yogurt for probiotics and healthy fats.

### **Mid-Morning Snack (Optional):**

- **Beef Jerky** or **Biltong**: This could be a protein-rich snack.
- Alternatively, you could have some **hard-boiled eggs** or **cheese** (if you consume dairy).

### **Lunch:**

- **Grilled Chicken/Goat Meat/Mutton**: Opt for tandoori-style chicken (without the sugar or carbs in marinade), grilled mutton, or even a fatty cut of beef.
- **Ghee or Butter**: Add ghee or butter on top of your meat for extra fat.
- **Bone Marrow**: If available, you can eat roasted bone marrow for a nutrient-dense, fatty option.

### **Afternoon Snack:**

- **Fish (like Salmon or local fish such as Pomfret)**: Fish is a good source of omega-3 fats.
- **Beef or Lamb Fat**: For an extra boost of animal fats, eat fatty cuts like lamb chops or beef fat.

### **Dinner:**

- **Goat Meat Curry** or **Beef Stew**: Choose a simple, traditional curry made without sugars or excessive carbs. Use bone-in cuts for more nutrients.
- **Eggs**: Boiled, scrambled, or fried eggs can be added to the dinner for extra protein.
- **Ghee** or **Butter**: Again, cook or drizzle ghee over your meat for added fat.

### **Optional:**

- **Fermented Foods**: You can include **fermented foods** like **sauerkraut** or **pickles** (check for no sugar in the pickle) to support digestion.

### **Hydration**:

- Drink **water** and **electrolyte-rich drinks** (like coconut water in moderation if desired).
- **Tea**: Black tea or green tea without sugar (you can use heavy cream or coconut milk if needed).

### Notes for Adapting the Diet in India:

1. **Meat and Animal Products**: The availability of meats like beef might be limited or culturally sensitive in certain regions. However, alternatives like chicken, mutton, goat meat, and fish are widely available.
2. **Ghee**: Ghee is perfect for Saladino’s approach, as it is a high-quality fat, rich in butyrate and other healthy fats.
3. **Organ Meats**: Liver, kidney, heart, etc., can be found in local markets, and they are nutrient-dense, aligning with the carnivore philosophy.
4. **Spices**: While Paul Saladino’s approach might be minimal in spices, you can keep Indian spices to a minimum if you're strictly following the diet but can still add basic seasonings like salt and pepper for flavor.
5. **Carbs**: Avoid rice, chapati, dal, and legumes (which are commonly consumed in India) as they are high in carbohydrates.

By using local animal products and foods, you can adapt the carnivore-based eating style to suit your needs and preferences while living in India.
