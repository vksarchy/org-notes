### **Shoot and Scoot**

A tactic where a unit fires on a target and immediately relocates to avoid counterfire. Commonly used by snipers, artillery, and mobile units.

### **Why?**

- **Avoid detection & return fire** (Counter-battery, drones, or direct fire threats).
- **Maintain mobility & unpredictability** (Prevents enemy from locking in on your position).
- **Exploit surprise & terrain** (Hit hard, vanish, repeat).

### **Execution:**

1. **Engage:** Fire on target (short, effective burst).
2. **Displace:** Move quickly to a new position.
3. **Repeat as needed.**

**Bottom line:** Fire, move, stay alive.

In a radio transmission, you’d keep it short and clear, using brevity codes if applicable.

### **Example Phrases:**

- **"Fire mission complete, displacing."** (Artillery/Mortar teams)
- **"Engaged, moving."** (General)
- **"Splash, scooting."** (After firing, informing you’re repositioning)
- **"Hitman 1-1, breaking contact, relocating."** (If under fire and repositioning)

If brevity codes are in play, some units use **"S&S"** or **"Exfil hot"** to indicate a rapid withdrawal after engagement.
