* German's will to power :
Here is a summary of the video "Civilization #54: The German Will to Power":

- The video is a lecture by Jiang Xueqin explaining the rise of Adolf Hitler as a product of German civilization’s obsession with the concept of unity of will, drawing on the philosophy of Schopenhauer, the music of Wagner, and the ideas of Nietzsche.
- It traces the evolution of German civilization, focusing on Prussia's transformation from a military power into a center of creativity, education, and culture, influencing all of Germany.
- The lecture highlights Prussia's contributions to the Enlightenment (notably Immanuel Kant), science, and reforms such as religious tolerance and compulsory public education.
- The unification of Germany under Prussian leadership was achieved through enlightened reforms and military victories, but also through cultural and intellectual progress.
- Bismarck is discussed as the founder of modern Germany, creating the welfare state and leading social reforms but facing opposition from Catholics and liberals.
- The aftermath of World War I—with national humiliation, political fragmentation, and economic hardship—created a longing for unity and a charismatic leader. Philosophers like Schopenhauer and Nietzsche influenced this German search for meaning and greatness.
- Schopenhauer’s idea of the "will" (desire as the force driving life and conflict) and Nietzsche’s correction to a “will to power” (the drive to assert and amplify desire) were central to German intellectual life, inspiring Wagner’s "Ring Cycle" opera, which became a national epic about the dangers and necessity of desire and unity.
- Nietzsche’s concept of the Übermensch—one who creates meaning and imposes their will—is described as a philosophical blueprint that was later co-opted by Hitler.
- The video shows how the Nazis’ rise was enabled by political and military elites trying to suppress socialism and restore national unity, supporting the Nazi party to counter left-wing opposition.
- Hitler emerges as the charismatic figure—the supposed new Übermensch—promising to restore German greatness, unify the people (“unity of will”), and seek vengeance for past defeats. His rhetoric and personality are compared to religious zeal, offering people belonging and purpose.
- The lecture underscores that the psychological need for unity and meaning can make people susceptible to powerful leaders, which explains not only the rise of Hitler but similar figures throughout history, even drawing a parallel to Donald Trump’s political movement.
- Ultimately, the destruction of Prussia and German centers of innovation after World War II is seen as a cultural loss for all humanity, as such centers of philosophy, science, and culture are essential for progress.

In short: The talk shows how German history, philosophy, and culture set the stage for Hitler by creating a desire for unity and greatness, nurtured by powerful intellectual and artistic traditions that could be manipulated towards authoritarian ends.
