* Combat System Overview

** Army Basics
*** Unit Types
- *Infantry* :: Cheap, essential frontline units
- *Cavalry* :: Expensive, useful for flanking in early game, less important later (except hordes, Poland, Ottomans)
- *Artillery* :: Expensive but crucial for sieges & late-game backline firepower

*** Manpower & Force Limit
- Manpower is your lifeblood; avoid attrition & unnecessary fights
- Force limit is a *soft cap* — exceeding it costs extra maintenance
- Force Limit represents the cap of "free" regiments
- Exceeding it increases maintenance costs drastically, which can bankrupt a nation

*** Generals & Pips
- Pips = combat effectiveness (fire, shock, maneuver, siege)
- *Shock* is stronger early game, *fire* dominates late game
- Higher maneuver helps negate terrain penalties
- Three ways to obtain generals:
  1. Recruit with military monarch points (army tradition influences quality)
  2. Make your ruler or heir a general
  3. Hire mercenary company with a general

** Battle Mechanics

*** Combat Phases
- Morale = health bar; reaching 0 loses battle
- Two phases: *fire phase* → *shock phase* (every 3 days)
- Each battle alternates between fire (uses fire pips) and shock (uses shock pips) phases
- Both frontline and back row units contribute differently

*** Terrain & Penalties
- Terrain & crossing penalties matter significantly
- Defending on tough terrain (mountains, rivers, forests) gives dice roll bonuses
- Forts guarantee defender status and add fort defense modifiers

*** Stackwipe
- Stackwipe = enemy has 0 morale + less than half your troops
- Occurs if a side's army hits zero morale and has less than half the troops of the winner within the first 4 combat rounds

*** Flanking
- Every unit has a base "flanking range" determining how many adjacent regiments it can hit
- Cavalry (typically flanking range of 2) exceeds infantry, striking more enemy units effectively
- Flanking works when combat width isn't completely filled

** Combat Width & Army Composition

*** Combat Width Explained
- Combat width = how many units fight at once
- Sets the max number of units per row in a battle
- Army composition should match current combat width
- Excess units rotate in as casualties occur

*** Composition by Game Phase
**** Early Game (Tech < 7)
- Mostly infantry + 2–4 cavalry
- 2 cavalry per flank (total of 4 for full combat width) is most cost-effective
- Don't exceed combat width

**** Mid-Game (Tech 7–15)
- Add artillery for sieges (not full combat width yet)
- Artillery provides siege bonus: 5 artillery per fort level maximizes siege progress

**** Late Game (Tech 16+)
- Full combat width infantry + artillery, minimal cavalry
- Artillery fights from back row, provides siege bonuses
- *Never compose army of only artillery* — they take double damage on frontline

** Sieges

*** Basic Mechanics
- Fort level × 3 = minimum siege troops
- Minimum: 3×fort garrison size + 1,000 troops needed to begin siege
- Artillery speeds sieges; naval blockade + artillery barrage = faster walls breached

*** Artillery Benefits
- 5 artillery per fort level maximizes siege progress
- Artillery increases siege ability when calculating monthly siege rolls

** Attrition & Reinforcement

*** Attrition Management
- Don't doomstack unnecessarily — attrition bleeds manpower
- Attrition represents percentage of troops lost monthly based on:
  - Province supply limits
  - Terrain
  - Seasons
- Keep stacks under supply limits and avoid harsh climates

*** Reinforcement Strategy
- Reinforce battles in waves to avoid artillery moving to frontline
- Split stacks to avoid attrition; reinforce only when needed
- Higher maneuver means faster movement, better reinforcement speed
- After battles, use "shift-consolidate" to merge weak regiments

** Army Modifiers

*** Early Game Focus
- Morale keeps armies from breaking
- Morale boosters (advisor, ideas) are crucial

*** Late Game Focus
- Discipline increases all damage dealt and reduces damage taken
- Military tactics is a multiplier reducing incoming losses
- Discipline & combat ability more impactful than morale
- Keep up with military tech to maintain tactics advantage

*** Army Professionalism
- Metric showing standing army quality
- Increases with drilling and hiring generals
- Using mercenaries reduces professionalism
- High professionalism gives bonuses:
  - Reliable reinforcements
  - Faster siege ability

* Advanced Combat Tactics

** General Tips
- Pick defensive terrain
- Bait AI into bad fights
- Consolidate damaged regiments after battles
- Use scorched earth & movement tricks to delay enemies

** Advanced Tricks
- Bait stacks into mountains, rivers, or forts
- Use Control + right-click to cancel locked movement
- Micro reinforcement timing so artillery stays safe
- *Always stay ahead in military tech* — tech advantage > numbers

* Mastery Roadmap

** Phase 1: Foundation (Early Game, Tech < 7)

*** Focus Areas
- Cheap infantry + 2–4 cavalry
- Morale boosters (advisor, ideas)
- Avoid bad terrain fights, play defensive
- Learn combat width & don't exceed it
- Practice shift-consolidation after battles

*** Goal
Win small, efficient battles, avoid attrition

** Phase 2: Transition (Mid Game, Tech 7–15)

*** Focus Areas
- Artillery for sieges (not full combat width yet)
- Learn siege mechanics (fort level, artillery bonus, naval blockades)
- Split stacks to avoid attrition; reinforce only when needed
- Maintain discipline & tactics via tech and ideas

*** Goal
Capture forts fast, minimize manpower drain

** Phase 3: Mastery (Late Game, Tech 16+)

*** Focus Areas
- Full combat width artillery + infantry
- Reinforcement waves to protect artillery from frontline
- Stack discipline, combat ability, & late-game firepower
- Use baiting, scorched earth, & terrain traps vs AI

*** Goal
Destroy enemies in decisive battles, stackwipe, and siege fast

* Unit-Specific Knowledge

** Cavalry Deep Dive

*** When Cavalry is Terrible (Most Cases)
- Twice as expensive as infantry in recruitment and maintenance
- Generally inefficient for most countries
- Management difficulty — infantry dies in center first, leaving cavalry overexposed
- Usefulness drops dramatically after military tech 16

*** When Cavalry is Essential
- Playing as Poland
- Playing as a horde nation
- Have significant cavalry combat ability bonuses (+50% or more)
- Hordes get cavalry bonuses and reduced cost

*** Cavalry Management Tips
- Small nations: disband starting cavalry to save money
- Exception: need it immediately for early wars (like France vs. England)
- After early wars, consolidate or remove cavalry regiments ASAP
- Can use a couple of cavalry units for optimal flanking until artillery dominates
- Some players use cavalry for manpower efficiency in decisive early wars

*** Community Perspectives
- With right bonuses (shock ability, general, etc.), cavalry stacks can be devastating
- Requires good economy and army quality
- Some use cavalry for fun, theme, or roleplay despite inefficiency
- *Bottom line:* Cavalry is mostly terrible unless you're Poland, a horde, or have huge cavalry combat ability bonuses

* Key Metrics Reference

** Combat Metrics
- Force Limit
- Flanking Range
- Combat Width
- Unit Pips (Fire, Shock, Maneuver, Siege)
- Morale
- Discipline
- Military Tactics

** Army Quality Metrics
- Army Tradition
- Army Professionalism
- Siege Ability

** Logistical Metrics

- Attrition

* Important Game Mechanics

** Clerical Education Privilege

*** Benefits
- -5% Technology cost
- +1 Tolerance of the True Faith

*** Why It Matters
1. *Cheaper Tech = Snowball Faster*
   - Tech is one of the biggest monarch point sinks
   - 5% discount stacks with other modifiers (Innovative ideas, neighbour bonus)
   - Over the campaign, saves hundreds of monarch points
   - Can be reinvested in development, coring, or ideas

2. *Tolerance of True Faith = Stability*
   - More tolerance = less unrest in provinces of state religion
   - Keeps stability costs down
   - Fewer rebellions
   - Better economy (not fighting rebels constantly)

3. *Synergy with Religious or Innovative Play*
   - Stacks with Innovative + Universities for tech leadership
   - Noticeable unrest reduction with religious unity focus

*** Strategic Value
- EU4 is fundamentally about mana efficiency
- Easiest early-game way to get tech discount
- Essential for tall or semi-tall gameplay
- 5% looks small but compounds significantly over 400 years

** Province War Score Cost

*** Definition
Amount of warscore needed to demand a province in peace deal

*** Calculation
- Base warscore cost determined by development (tax + production + manpower)
- Roughly: each point of development = 1 warscore cost
- Example: 20-dev province ≈ 20 warscore

*** Modifiers
**** Province-Based
- Capitals cost more
- High trade power centers cost more
- Important fort locations cost more

**** Ideas & Policies
- Influence idea group reduces province war score cost

**** Casus Belli Effects
- Conquest CB → normal warscore cost
- Reconquest CB → cores of vassals cost only 75% warscore
- Imperialism CB → all provinces cost 25% less warscore

**** Special Circumstances
- Holy Roman Empire: non-members pay extra for HRE land

*** Strategic Implications
- Warscore capped at 100
- High-development provinces (Paris, Constantinople) very expensive
- Single 40-warscore province limits other conquest options
- Plan peace deals around warscore costs
