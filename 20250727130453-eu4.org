Here’s a **compressed summary** of the combat guide and a **clear roadmap** for mastering EU4 warfare:

---

## 📌 **Summary: How Warfare Works in EU4**

1. **Army Basics**

   * **Infantry** = cheap, essential frontline.
   * **Cavalry** = expensive, useful for flanking in early game, less important later (except hordes, Poland, Ottomans).
   * **Artillery** = expensive but crucial for sieges & late-game backline firepower.

2. **Manpower & Force Limit**

   * Manpower is your lifeblood; avoid attrition & unnecessary fights.
   * Force limit is a **soft cap**—exceeding it costs extra maintenance.

3. **Generals & Pips**

   * Pips = combat effectiveness (fire, shock, maneuver, siege).
   * **Shock** is stronger early game, **fire** dominates late game.
   * Higher maneuver helps negate terrain penalties.

4. **Battles**

   * Morale = health bar; reaching 0 loses battle.
   * Two phases: **fire phase** → **shock phase** (every 3 days).
   * Terrain & crossing penalties matter a lot.
   * Stackwipe = enemy has 0 morale + less than half your troops.

5. **Combat Width & Composition**

   * Combat width = how many units fight at once.
   * Early game: mostly infantry + 2–4 cavalry.
   * Mid-game: add artillery for sieges.
   * Late game: full combat width infantry + artillery, minimal cavalry.

6. **Sieges**

   * Fort level × 3 = minimum siege troops.
   * Artillery speeds sieges; naval blockade + artillery barrage = faster walls breached.

7. **Attrition & Reinforcement**

   * Don’t doomstack unnecessarily—attrition bleeds manpower.
   * Reinforce battles in waves to avoid artillery moving to the frontline.

8. **Army Modifiers**

   * Early game = morale important.
   * Late game = discipline & combat ability more impactful.
   * Keep up with military tech to maintain tactics advantage.

9. **General Tips**

   * Pick defensive terrain.
   * Bait AI into bad fights.
   * Consolidate damaged regiments after battles.
   * Use scorched earth & movement tricks to delay enemies.

## Complete Answers to the EU4 Army & Warfare Quiz
(with Relevant Metrics Explained)

### Unit Types & Composition

1. **Three primary types of land units:**
   - **Infantry:** Core frontline unit; cheapest; absorbs most casualties.
   - **Cavalry:** Fights on flanks; greater flanking range (metric: flanking range), higher shock damage (shock pips), but more expensive.
   - **Artillery:** Fights from the back row (metric: back row fire); provides siege bonuses; expensive and vulnerable if in the frontline.

2. **Importance of not exceeding force limit:**
   - **Force Limit** is a metric representing the cap of “free” regiments. Exceeding it increases maintenance costs drastically, which can bankrupt a nation. Going above is only justified with substantial economic advantages or temporary, critical wars.

3. **Efficient cavalry number per flank:**
   - 2 cavalry per flank (total of 4 for a full combat width) is most cost-effective. Metric: Cavalry’s flanking range—they efficiently attack adjacent enemy units without overextending.

4. **Army composed of only artillery regiments:**
   - Artillery alone cannot fill the frontline and, if forced to the front, takes double damage and is wiped easily (metrics: front row/back row, artillery vulnerability).

### Generals & Army Leaders

5. **Three ways to obtain a general:**
   - Recruit with military monarch points (metric: army tradition influences quality).
   - Make your ruler or heir a general (metric: ruler’s monarch points affect pips).
   - Hire mercenary company with a general (metric: mercenary tradition).

6. **What are “pips,” and their value by era:**
   - “Pips” are metrics indicating a general’s/combat unit’s capability in Fire, Shock, Maneuver, and Siege. Early game: shock pips are most valuable due to low firepower. Late game: fire and siege pips become more important due to increased artillery and firearm tech.

7. **Maneuver pip benefits:**
   - Higher maneuver means faster movement, better reinforcement speed, and negates some terrain/river crossing penalties (metrics: movement speed, terrain penalty reduction).

### Battle System & Mechanics

8. **Primary combat phases and relevant metrics:**
   - Each battle alternates between **fire** (uses fire pips) and **shock** (uses shock pips) phases, with both frontline and back row units contributing differently.

9. **Stackwipe definition and criteria:**
   - Occurs if a side’s army hits zero morale and has less than half the troops of the winner within the first 4 combat rounds (metrics: morale, troop count ratio).

10. **How flanking works, and its metrics:**
    - Every unit has a base “flanking range” determining how many adjacent regiments it can hit. Cavalry (typically flanking range of 2) exceeds infantry, striking more enemy units effectively.

### Sieges & Attrition

11. **Minimum troops for siege:**
    - 3×fort garrison size (a fixed metric shown in-game) + 1,000 troops are needed even to begin a siege.

12. **Artillery’s siege role (metric):**
    - Artillery provides siege bonus: 5 artillery per fort level maximizes siege progress. Also, artillery increases siege ability when calculating monthly siege rolls.

13. **Attrition effects and minimization:**
    - Attrition represents a percentage of troops lost monthly based on province supply limits, terrain, and seasons. Keep stacks under supply limits and avoid harsh climates for minimal losses. Metric: supply limit, attrition rate.

### Army Metrics & Modifiers

14. **Morale early, discipline late—why:**
    - Early game: morale (metric) keeps armies from breaking. Late game: discipline (increases all damage dealt) and military tactics (mitigates losses) outscale basic morale.

15. **Discipline/military tactics in battle:**
    - Each point of discipline boosts your troops’ overall damage dealt and reduces damage taken. Military tactics is a multiplier reducing incoming losses—a higher value gives a distinct edge.

16. **Army professionalism—what is it and how changed:**
    - Metric showing standing army quality. Increases with drilling and hiring generals. Using mercenaries reduces professionalism. High professionalism gives bonuses (e.g., reliable reinforcements, faster siege ability).

17. **Combat width role in composition:**
    - “Combat width” sets the max number of units per row in a battle. Army composition should match current combat width metric—excess units rotate in as casualties occur. (E.g., if combat width is 20, aim for 20 infantry/artillery up front/back.)

### Strategy & General Tips

18. **Doomstacking risks:**
    - Moving the full force together leads to excessive attrition (attrition metric), draining manpower and funds, even before battles.

19. **Terrain/fortification advantage:**
    - Defending on tough terrain (metric: terrain type—mountains, rivers, forests) gives dice roll bonuses/penalties and better defensive outcomes. Forts guarantee defender status and add fort defense modifiers for battles within their zone.

20. **What to do with damaged units:**
    - Use “shift-consolidate” to merge weak regiments (metrics: regiment strength, combat effectiveness). Keeps your frontline strong and prevents weak units from dying in upcoming battles.

### Key Metrics Recap

- Force Limit
- Flanking Range
- Combat Width
- Unit Pips (Fire, Shock, Maneuver, Siege)
- Morale
- Discipline
- Military Tactics
- Army Tradition
- Army Professionalism
- Supply Limit
- Attrition
- Siege Ability

Mastery of these metrics will make you far more effective at managing armies and winning wars in EU4.

** Cavalry
Summary of "EU4 Cavalry is TERRIBLE" by Florryworry:

Cavalry in EU4, though expensive, has more shock damage and flanking range than infantry, but is rarely worth the cost.

Flanking Range: Cavalry deals more damage from the sides if the combat width isn’t filled, but you’re likely to win that fight without cavalry anyway.

Cost Effectiveness: Cavalry is twice as expensive as infantry in recruitment and maintenance, making it generally inefficient for most countries.

When To Use Cavalry:

Essential only if you are playing as Poland, a horde nation, or have significant cavalry combat ability bonuses (+50% or more).

Hordes and similar nations: Cavalry becomes much better due to bonuses and reduced cost.

Management Difficulty: Using lots of cavalry is micromanagement-heavy. Infantry dies in the center first, leaving cavalry overexposed in multi-battle scenarios.

Patch Changes: Some updates have scaled cavalry stats, making them “slightly less bad,” but no major overhaul to their issues.

Starting Cavalry: If playing as a small nation, you should disband starting cavalry to save money, unless you need it immediately for early wars (like France vs. England).

Transition Point: After early wars, consolidate or remove cavalry regiments as soon as possible.

Optimizing Battles: Full micro-optimization (like staggering infantry/cavalry arrivals) is too much hassle and detracts from big strategic decisions.

Mercenary Cavalry: You can’t choose the composition of mercenary companies - they bring cavalry even if you don’t want or need it.

Key Point:

Unless you have strong cavalry bonuses or play a horde, cavalry generally isn’t worth using due to high costs and minimal advantages over infantry.

Extra community takes (from comments):

Some players argue cavalry is manpower efficient for small nations and advantageous for decisive early wars.

With right bonuses (shock ability, general, etc.), cavalry stacks can be devastating—but require good eco and army quality.

Some like to use a couple of cavalry units for optimal flanking until artillery becomes dominant.

Cavalry usefulness drops dramatically after military tech 16 when artillery and firepower start to matter more than shock.

Flex and tradition: Some use cavalry just for fun, theme, or roleplay, knowing it’s inefficient!

Bottom line:
Cavalry is mostly terrible in EU4 unless you’re Poland, a horde, or have huge cavalry combat ability bonuses. For most nations, disband and rely on infantry!


* Clerical Education
Good question, Bravo 1. Let’s strip it down.

The **Clerical Education** modifier in **EU4** comes from estate privileges (usually from the Clergy estate, depending on religion). It typically gives:

** **-5% Technology cost**
** **+1 Tolerance of the True Faith**

### Why it matters:

1. **Cheaper Tech = Snowball Faster**

   * Tech is one of the biggest monarch point sinks in the game.
   * A 5% discount stacks with other modifiers (Innovative ideas, neighbour bonus, etc.).
   * Over the course of the game, you save **hundreds of monarch points** → which can be reinvested in development, coring, or ideas.

2. **Tolerance of the True Faith = Stability in Core Lands**

   * More tolerance = less unrest in provinces of your state religion.
   * Keeps stability costs down, fewer rebellions, and better economy because you’re not fighting rebels every other year.

3. **Synergy with Religious or Innovative Play**

   * If you lean into religious unity, the unrest reduction is noticeable.
   * If you stack tech discounts (Innovative + Universities + Clerical Education), you can become a **tech leader**, outpacing rivals militarily.

### Why you *need* it (or at least why it’s good):

** In EU4, the game is basically a fight for **mana efficiency**. Anything that reduces the cost of monarch points is gold.
** Clerical Education is one of the easiest early-game ways to get a tech discount without heavy investment.
** If you’re running a tall or semi-tall game, this privilege pays for itself many times over.

👉 In short:
You take **Clerical Education** because **mana is life** in EU4. A 5% tech discount looks small, but over 400 years it turns you into a sharper, faster, and stronger nation.

Do you want me to run you a **mana savings example** (how many monarch points you actually save with Clerical Education across the campaign)?

*
* Provice War Cost
In **Europa Universalis IV**, the **province war score cost** is the amount of **warscore** you need to demand that province in a peace deal.

** Each province has a **base warscore cost**, which is mostly determined by its **development** (tax + production + manpower).

  * Roughly, **each point of development = 1 warscore cost** (modified by other factors).
  * Example: A 20-dev province will usually cost around **20 warscore**.

** **Modifiers that affect province warscore cost:**

  * **Province modifiers:** Some provinces (capitals, high trade power centres, or important fort locations) are more expensive.
  * **Ideas & Policies:** For example, the **Influence idea group** has a reduction to province war score cost, making conquest cheaper.
  * **Casus Belli:** Some CBs change the cost. For instance:

    * **Conquest CB** → normal warscore cost.
    * **Reconquest CB** → provinces that are cores of your vassals cost only **75% warscore**.
    * **Imperialism CB** → all provinces cost **25% less warscore**.
  * **Being in the Holy Roman Empire:** Non-members trying to take HRE land may pay extra.

** **Strategic meaning:**

  * Warscore is capped at 100. If a single province costs 40 warscore, you won’t be able to grab much else in that war.
  * High-development provinces (e.g., Paris, Constantinople) are very “expensive” to take in one go.

👉 So in short:
**Province warscore cost = how much peace deal leverage you must spend to demand a province. It scales with development and is modified by CB, ideas, and circumstances.**

Do you want me to also break down **how to *see* province war score cost in-game** (like where it’s displayed when you hover)?
