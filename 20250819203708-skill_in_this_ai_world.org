The **only trait for success in the AI era**, according to Po-Shen Loh, is *thoughtfulness*—the capacity for deep, genuine, independent thinking and empathy.

Key points:
- **AI can outperform humans in creativity and logical problem-solving**, even solving Olympiad-level math problems, so traditional skills are no longer unique to humans.
- What remains uniquely human—and essential—is the *desire and ability to create real value for others* through kindness, collaboration, and understanding.
- In the future, survival and success will depend on building networks of trustworthy, empathetic, and capable people who work well together.
- Essential skills for the next generation are **critical thinking, communication, and the genuine wish to help others**, rather than just technical proficiency or competition.
- Loh urges developing a thoughtful mindset, strong community, and the ability to “simulate the world,” meaning to see problems through others’ eyes with empathy and perspective.
- He believes true fulfillment (and success) comes from making others happy and contributing positively to society.[1]

In summary: **Thoughtfulness (deep thinking + empathy + value creation for others) is the most important trait for success in the AI age**.[1]
