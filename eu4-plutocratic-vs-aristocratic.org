#+title:Eu4 Plutocratic Vs Aristocratic

Ah — **Plutocratic Ideas in EU4** is actually a very interesting and often misunderstood idea group. I’ll explain it like a veteran EU4 player would, not just mechanically but **strategically, historically, and gameplay-meta wise.**

---

# 🏛️ What “Plutocratic” Means (Real World Context)

**Plutocracy = Rule by the wealthy.**

In EU4 terms:

* Power concentrated in **merchants, burghers, traders, urban elites**
* Focus on **commerce, professionalism, economic strength + flexible military**
* Not aristocratic (nobles)
* Not divine/religious
* Not purely militaristic

👉 Think Venice, Netherlands, Genoa, merchant republics, wealthy city states.

# ⚔️ In EU4: What Is the Plutocratic Idea Group?

It’s an **Administrative idea group available mainly to republics** (not monarchies normally unless modded).

It’s a hybrid group:

✔ Economic bonuses
✔ Military quality boosts
✔ Trade/merchant synergy
✔ Stability/internal development benefits

**Basically: Economic-military hybrid idea group.**
