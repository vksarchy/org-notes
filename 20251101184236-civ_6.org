* Masternig the first 50 turns
** Main Strategy Goals**
- **Settle 3–5 Cities:** By turn 50, prioritize expanding quickly for a strong empire foundation.
- **Produce 3–5 Units:** Early units are essential for defense against barbarians and nearby civilizations.
- **Make 1 Friend (Ally):** Secure a trading partner and potential military support.
- **Identify 10 Potential City Sites:** Strategically place your cities to block out rivals and plan for expansion.
- **Establish Perimeter:** Choose settlement spots to extend borders and defend viable city locations.
- **Build 2 Strong Cities:** Your capital and at least one other should be productive, well-placed, and able to support core infrastructure.

** Early Turn Execution Details**
- **Settling the Capital:**
  - Move your settler for optimal placement (2 food/2 production, 3 food tiles are ideal).
  - Spending the first turn moving for a better spot is fine.
- **Starting Build Order:**
  - Double slinger → monument → settler (recommended).
  - Avoid early scouts/builders; slingers give defense and can be upgraded to archers.
  - Monument boosts culture, settler increases expansion.
- **Early Tech/Civic Choices:**
  - Tech: Choose based on nearby resources, e.g., mining → writing → irrigation.
  - Civic: Code of Laws → Foreign Trade → Early Empire → Political Philosophy (aim for the government change at turn 50).
- **District Planning:**
  - Use mods like Better Map Tax for optimal adjacency.
  - Prioritize campus, commercial hub, industrial zone, theater square, aqueduct.
  - Build wonders only when feasible (Petra, Coliseum, Artemis are generally doable).
- **Exploration:**
  - Meet city-states for envoy boosts and explore for good city spots, especially near rivers/freshwater.
  - Watch for barbarians — they’re more dangerous than rival AI in early turns.
  - Find tribal villages/goody huts for bonuses.

** Mid-Game Transition Preparation**
- **Governor Choices:**
  - Go for Magnus (for settler production, no population loss) and Pingala (science/culture boost) as early priorities.
- **Pantheon Selection:**
  - Pick based on map and goals: Religious Settlements for free settler, Fertility Rites for growth/builder, God of the Forge for unit production.
- **Policy Cards:**
  - Use Discipline and God King early on, then shift to Urban Colonization and Charismatic Leader as you unlock governments.
- **Dealing with Civs and Barbarians:**
  - Try to befriend close civs (e.g., Genghis Khan) and avoid antagonizing strong early military leaders.
  - Kill units with slingers for Archery boost, defeat barbarians for Bronze Working.

** Final Turn 50 Milestones**
- **Political Philosophy Government Choice:**
  - Classical Republic for most playthroughs (housing, amenities, great person points).
  - Autocracy for wonders, Oligarchy for military campaigns.
- **City/Unit Count:**
  - Should have 3–5 cities, 3–5 units, mapped future expansion sites, two strong cities developing infrastructure.
- **Immediate Next Steps:**
  - Secure new cities, defend borders, keep expanding, and prepare for mid-game strategy shifts.

** Key Takeaways**
- **Optimize city placement, build order, and tech/civic progress for a dominant early game.**
- **Defend against barbarians, make early alliances, and always plan expansion.**
- **Flexible district and wonder placement using map tools/mods for adjacency.**
- **Transition to mid-game with ideal government and governor setup by turn 50.**

The guide is hands-on, play-along style, following a Deity China start but with strategies universally applicable to most Civ 6 games. The creator invites viewers to request guides for further turns.

* The best Tech Tree start:
Excellent — you’re looking at the early **Technology Tree** in *Civilization VI*, and this is *the* crucial phase that defines your tempo for the next 100 turns. Let’s break this down with a cunning Toranaga-style eye for leverage, not just progress.


### 🎯 What You’re Seeing

You’ve unlocked or can unlock:

 * **Pottery**
 * **Animal Husbandry**
 * **Mining**
  And are viewing possible next paths: Archery, Writing, Astrology, Masonry, etc.

## 🧭 Step 1: Scout the Map, then Decide the Tech Line

Your **best start** depends on what your surroundings give you. But since I can see the coastline and a few plains/hills — I’ll give you the optimal openers based on archetypes:


### 🪓 If You’re Surrounded by Forests / Hills → **Mining First**

* Unlocks: chopping, mines, production boost.
* Boosts Bronze Working later.
* You can find Iron — massive for early wars.
* Follow-up: **Bronze Working → Iron Working → Swordsmen dominance.**
* **Cunning Play:** You can delay Bronze Working’s completion until you kill 3 barbarians (for the eureka).


### 🐄 If You Have Cattle / Horses Nearby → **Animal Husbandry First**

* Reveals horses (critical if you plan an early cavalry or scout rush).
* Leads to **Archery** (which gives you ranged dominance fast).
* **Cunning Play:** Build a scout → slinger → builder. The slinger’s first kill gives you the **Archery boost**, cutting research time in half.


### 🏺 If You Have a Strong River / Food Start → **Pottery → Writing**

* Leads to **Writing**, allowing Campuses for science acceleration.
* Works best for tall, peaceful openings or science civs (like Korea, Babylon, etc.).
* **Cunning Play:** Don’t complete Writing until you’ve found a natural wonder or met 2 civs for eurekas.


### 🌞 If You See a Natural Wonder / Religious Civ → **Astrology**

* Unlocks Holy Sites, leading to early faith economy or religion rush.
* **Cunning Play:** Only worth it if you have a wonder nearby or are aiming for early faith synergy.


## 🔧 Toranaga’s Tactical Tech Order Templates

| Objective          | Ideal Tech Order                            | Reasoning                            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 🛡️ Early Defense  | Mining → Bronze Working → Archery           | Reveal Iron + ranged defense         |
| ⚔️ Early Rush     | Animal Husbandry → Archery → Bronze Working | Archers + find Iron for next wave    |
| 📚 Science Start  | Pottery → Writing → Mining                  | Early Campus + resource access       |
| 🕊️ Religion Start | Pottery → Astrology → Mining                | Holy Site + chop production          |
| 🏗️ Balanced       | Animal Husbandry → Mining → Writing         | Vision, production, and science base |


## 💡 Bonus Cunning Tips

* **Delay completion** of techs until their Eureka triggers are close — that’s a 40–50% science savings.
* Build 1–2 **scouts early** — information is the true currency of war and growth.
* Don’t be tempted by Masonry early unless you have stone resources *and* plan to build walls or Pyramids.

If you tell me:

* Your **Civ (e.g. Japan, Rome, etc.)**
* What terrain/resources you spawned near
* Whether you’re aiming for **war, science, or religion**

I can give you a *precise 20-turn tech build order* to dominate your start.

So, Bravo 1 — what’s your Civ and what do you see around your capital?


* For Japan
** Overview
Excellent, Bravo 1 — Japan near water. That’s a *dream start* for a cunning player.
Japan’s entire design is about **compact efficiency and adjacency bonuses** — and coastal positioning turns you into a tactical powerhouse if played right.

Let’s break it down like a Toranaga campaign plan.


** 🇯🇵 Japan’s Core Strengths
Leader :: *Hojo Tokimune*

- 🏯 **Meiji Restoration** → Districts get +1 adjacency from *each other.*
  - Cluster tightly for high yields.
- ⚔️ **Divine Wind** → +5 Combat Strength for land units on coasts and naval units in shallow water.
- ⛩️ **Unique Assets**
  - *Electronics Factory* → empire-wide production later.
  - *Samurai* → mid-game unit that keeps full strength when damaged.

Japan thrives on **tight coastal cities**, **balanced development**, and **early district synergy** (especially Holy Sites + Campuses).

** ⚙️ 20-Turn Tech Build Order (Water Start)
| Turn Range | Tech                            | Reason |
|-------------+---------------------------------+--------|
| **1–9**    | **Mining**                      | Chop forests, unlock mines — base production line. |
| **10–18**  | **Pottery → Writing**           | First **Campus**; Japan easily gets +3 adjacency near mountain or Holy Site. |
| **19–24**  | **Sailing**                     | Coastal bonus; unlocks Fishing Boats and Harbours. |
| **25–35**  | **Animal Husbandry**            | Reveals Horses, boosts early military prep. |
| **36–45**  | **Archery** (via Slinger kills) | Early defense and barbarian control. |
| **46–60**  | **Astrology**                   | Holy Site + Campus synergy near water. |

---

** 🧱 Build Order (Parallel)
- **T 1–5:** Scout → find Natural Wonder / City-State for eurekas.
- **T 5–10:** Slinger → Builder.
- **T 10–20:** Settler
  - Chop forests strategically into Settler.
  - Found 2nd city near coast / river.

*Builder Actions*
1. Mine a hill.
2. Improve a luxury or resource.
3. Chop a forest to boost Settler or Campus.

---

** 💡 Toranaga-Style Synergy Trick
Cluster districts like this:

#+begin_src text
     Holy Site
  Campus   Government Plaza
     Harbour
#+end_src

Each district gives +1 adjacency to all others (Japan trait).
This creates a **+7 total adjacency web** from only four tiles — absurd efficiency.

---

** ⚔️ Cunning Expansion Plan
_By Turn 40_
- Two cities, each on or near coast.
- Capital → Campus started.
- Second city → Holy Site or Harbour.
- Archers + Builders online.

_By Turn 60_
- Unlock **Bronze Working → Iron**.
- If Iron → plan Samurai timing attack (T 80–100).
- Else → pivot to Naval dominance fast(Harbours + Galleys).

---

** 🧠 Power Principle
#+begin_quote
“A wise daimyo builds not where it is rich, but where it will become strong.”
#+end_quote

- Build on **coastlines** for adjacency + naval production.
- Delay religion; balance **Science + Faith** until Great Prophet secured.
- Use **chops** tactically to speed Campuses and Settlers.

---

* 🇯🇵 Japan Coastal District Blueprint
** Objective
Maximize adjacency and early returns on Science, Faith, and Gold while preparing production zones later.

---

** 🗺️ 1. Core Diamond Formation (Early–Mid Game)
#+begin_src text
      ⛩️ Holy Site
 ⚓ Harbour   🏛️ Government Plaza
      🎓 Campus
#+end_src

- Each district +1 adjacency to others.
- Harbour +2 from coast +1 from Plaza = +3.
- Campus +1 from Holy Site +1 from Plaza = +2 (min +3 with mountain).
- Holy Site +1 each from Harbour + Campus = +2.

→ **+7 adjacency web** from 4 tiles.

---

** 🧭 2. Position Relative to Coast
#+begin_src md
🌊 🌊 ⚓ 🌊
   🏙️ 🎓 ⛩️
     🏛️
#+end_src

- 🏙️ City Center = 1 tile from coast
- ⚓ Harbour = on coast
- 🎓 Campus = inland / near mountain
- ⛩️ Holy Site = next to Campus
- 🏛️ Gov Plaza = touches Campus + Holy Site

Result → +3 Harbour / +3 Campus / +3 Holy Site (before T 60).

---

** ⚙️ 3. Expansion Layout (Industrial + Commercial)
Later, build this *second cluster* in your high-production city:

#+begin_src text
⛏️ Industrial Zone
🏭 Factory (later)
🏛️ Gov Plaza (overlaps if close)
💰 Commercial Hub
#+end_src

- Industrial next to Plaza + Hub = +3 adjacency baseline.
- Commercial Hub next to Harbour = +2 adjacency baseline.

→ **Harbour + Hub** = economic engine.
→ **Industrial + Plaza** = military factory.

---

** 🪓 4. Builder & Chop Sequence (T 20–60)
1. Mine two hills → base production.
2. Chop forest → speed Campus / Settler.
3. *Lay district pins early* to lock costs and adjacencies.

---

** 🧠 Toranaga’s Cunning Insight
#+begin_quote
“A fortress is not walls and spears. It is the discipline of arrangement.”
#+end_quote

Avoid early wonders.
Build **districts that empower each other.**
Japan’s cities become interlocking gears — Science feeds Faith, Faith feeds Production.

** Optional Next Step
If you share your capital’s exact terrain (coast direction, mountains, forests, hills),
TOX can draft a **tile-by-tile tactical map** for perfect
