==Such great techniqus from the zen masters ins preserving the zen knowledge==

* Statues of wisdom by the YouTube Channel
 - Today the things that i learnt from them are the following :
 - The 5 ways are:
** Mode switching gives you energy
** Collecting informatons and use it as strategic
** Daily contact maintains momentum
** Minimum dose preserves the flame
** Strategic emptiness is where it all synthesises into greater work
* Infinite Energy
The video explains five key Japanese concepts related to mastering energy and avoiding burnout, using examples from history, culture, and martial arts:

1. **Gambaru & Gaman (Perseverance with Balance)**
   - **Gambaru** means pushing hard, giving full effort—honorable but only for critical moments.
   - **Gaman** means enduring patiently and calmly without wasting energy on every moment.
   - *Example:* Samurai saved Gambaru for the decisive strike rather than exhausting themselves constantly. Tokugawa’s siege showed patience (Gaman) to weaken the enemy, then focused Gambaru for the attack.

2. **Ikki-Tousen (One Force, Thousand Results)**
   - Focus all your energy on one critical point rather than spreading yourself thin over many.
   - *Example:* Samurai holding a bridge against many by concentrating force on one breakthrough point; kendo students practice one strike thousands of times to master it fully; katana sword is designed to do one thing (cutting) perfectly.

3. **Shu-Ha-Ri (Stages of Mastery)**
   - Three stages:
     - **Shu:** Copying rules exactly, which is mentally exhausting.
     - **Ha:** Breaking and adapting rules, requiring less energy.
     - **Ri:** Freedom from rules, mastery becomes effortless.
   - *Example:* A new driver is exhausted (Shu), but an experienced driver can drive long distances easily (Ri); masters work flows unconsciously, gaining energy instead of losing it.

4. **Makoto (Authenticity and Truthfulness)**
   - Energy drains when you pretend or perform instead of being authentic.
   - *Example:* Saying yes when you want to say no, fake smiles, or forced enthusiasm wastes energy; a potter who works honestly with clay has no energy drain, vs. people constantly acting who burn out quickly.

5. **Zanshin (Awareness After Action)**
   - The mindful space after completing something where energy is restored rather than lost.
   - *Example:* In Kyudo (Japanese archery), awareness after releasing the arrow ensures success; calligraphy masters hold their brush steady after finishing a stroke to absorb the moment’s energy; rushing immediately to the next task causes mental residue and energy drain.

**Summary:**
These concepts show that sustainable energy comes not from constant force but from balanced effort, focused attention, progressing through mastery stages, living authentically, and mindful transitions. Applying these principles helps avoid exhaustion and builds lasting power.

* Get so good ppl can't ignore you
Here is a summary of the key points and Japanese techniques featured in the video "Get So Good People Can't Ignore You (Miyamoto Musashi)":

**Main Points:**

1. **The Gift of Desperation:**
   - Miyamoto Musashi began life abandoned and without traditional training or privilege.
   - His desperation forced him to innovate, as he had nothing to lose and no reputation to protect.
   - Lack of conventional resources and support pushed him to develop unique skills out of necessity.
   - Desperation removes alternatives, focusing energy on survival and innovation.

2. **The Power of Not Belonging:**
   - Musashi deliberately stayed independent, refusing to join established dojos or take a master.
   - In feudal Japan, this meant being a ronin—socially ostracized but free to learn from every discipline and craft.
   - He absorbed influences from monks, artists, craftsmen, and farmers, allowing him to create the “Niten Ichi-ryū” (Two Heavens as One) style—fighting with two swords.
   - Independence and isolation preserved his uniqueness and facilitated innovation.

3. **The Discipline of Obsession:**
   - Musashi spent years ruthlessly testing techniques, keeping what worked and discarding what didn’t.
   - Every daily activity became training; mastery required relentless practice and self-audit.
   - He cultivated “no mind” (mushin), the ability to respond instinctively without conscious thought, developed through deep practice and self-reflection.

4. **The Art of Undeniable Proof:**
   - Skills must be demonstrated publicly to build reputation and recognition.
   - Musashi systematically documented his victories and methods, leaving a legacy (notably through his book "The Book of Five Rings").
   - Confidence is built through evidence—demonstrated results matter more than claims or self-affirmation.
   - Reputation grows through consistent, memorable demonstration rather than hidden mastery.

**Japanese Techniques/Philosophies Highlighted:**

- **Mushin (無心, "no mind")**: Reaching a state where actions become instinctive, free from overthinking, through intense preparation and practice.
- **Niten Ichi-ryū (二天一流)**: Musashi’s signature style of sword-fighting using two swords simultaneously, considered radical during his time.
- **Zen Meditation and Strategic Isolation**: Drawing from meditation practices and the philosophies of Zen monks to cultivate focus, patience, and self-reliance.
- **Kaizen (改善, Continuous Improvement) Mentality**: Constant refinement through testing and discarding ineffective methods, aiming for relentless self-betterment.
- **Metzuke (目付け, "Seeing the Whole")**: The art of maintaining broad awareness while tracking individual details—a strategic samurai skill found in both combat and life.

**Actionable Wisdom:**
- Desperation can be a gift—it focuses your energy.
- Refuse to be limited by tradition; use strategic independence to cultivate unique skills.
- Obsession and deep practice turn skills into instinct.
- Public proof and results, not hidden mastery, build legacy.

The video weaves these Japanese concepts into timeless life and career lessons—showing how Musashi’s path from abandonment to undoubted mastery was achieved through innovation, independence, relentless practice, and undeniable proof.

* Kushinryu System
Here’s a summary of the video "Become Addicted To Doing Hard Things (Kushinryu System)" and the Japanese technique described:

**Key Points from the Video:**
- Most people struggle daily because no one teaches them the true mechanics of discipline.
- The video highlights how modern comfort (apps, entertainment, instant gratification) has “hijacked” our brains, making us seek unearned pleasure and avoid difficulty.
- This constant comfort leads to physical and mental weakness, decision fatigue, and loss of satisfaction from genuine achievement.
- Willpower and forced discipline often fail, as fighting resistance depletes mental energy quickly (“resistance paradox”).
- The video uses a story of "Gohan", who fails by forcing himself through discipline but succeeds when he aligns effort with curiosity and removes internal resistance.
- The message: Instead of running from pain, reinterpret it as the path to growth and fulfillment.

**The Japanese Technique: Kushinryu System**
- Kushinryu combines two principles:
  - **Kushin (苦心)**: "Painful effort"—embracing discomfort as a teacher, not an enemy. Pain becomes the material from which growth and wisdom are built.
  - **Ryu (流)**: "Flow"—acting without force, as in Zen or Taoist philosophy. Rather than pushing against resistance, you flow around it or with it, building consistency and momentum.
- The **three pillars of the Kushinryu method**:
  1. **Dawn Protocol**: Do the hardest thing first thing in the morning, before your mind can resist.
  2. **Progressive Loading**: Always go slightly beyond your previous best (e.g., 10 push-ups → 11), breaking psychological barriers.
  3. **Pleasure Delay**: Only enjoy rewards (like coffee, entertainment) after completing hard work, reprogramming your brain for "pain first, pleasure after."
- By following these, you rewire yourself to crave difficulty and growth, making hard things automatic and enjoyable—no motivation needed.
- The system emphasizes **building identity and momentum**: In 30 days, hard effort becomes second nature, and you become stronger—mentally and physically—by seeking and mastering discomfort rather than avoiding it.[1]

This approach is rooted in samurai and Zen practices but is applied in a modern, practical way to defeat procrastination, increase resilience, and find self-mastery.

* How to kill any addiction:
**Key Takeaways from "How to Actually Kill Any Addiction (Miyamoto Musashi)"**

- **Addiction is Identity:**
  - Addiction isn’t just a bad habit—it's embedded in your identity.
  - Miyamoto Musashi’s addiction to dueling was not just behavior; it was his identity as a “duelist.” Fighting to quit habits that define your identity using willpower will almost always fail.

- **You Can't Remove, You Must Replace:**
  - Trying to subtract addiction from your life without changing identity is missing the point.
  - Musashi’s transformation came from *adding* new elements to his life—painting, philosophy, teaching. Gradually, his identity evolved to the point where dueling no longer defined him.
  - To overcome addiction, introduce new passions, relationships, or meaningful pursuits that crowd out the addictive identity over time.

- **Make Environment Work for the New You:**
  - Musashi’s principle: *The warrior chooses the battlefield.*
  - You need to change your environment to make it easier to live your new identity and harder to fall into addictive patterns (e.g., deleting triggering apps, joining new social circles, making healthy activities more accessible).
  - Tell someone about your struggle—secrecy feeds addiction.

- **Build the 60-Second Interrupt:**
  - Most addictions run on automation—trigger, reaction, gratification, in seconds.
  - Musashi mastered the pause, creating space between stimulus and response.
  - The tool: When a trigger/urge hits, pause for 60 seconds. Don’t fight or indulge it—just wait, observe, and consciously choose your next action from your new identity.

- **Gradual Transformation, Not Overnight Change:**
  - True identity shift is slow, taking months or years, not weeks. Expect setbacks and slips—they're part of the progress.
  - Over time, your new identity becomes dominant, and the addiction fades into irrelevance, not by force but by neglect as you starve it of attention and necessity.

- **Practical Steps to Start:**
  - Focus on changing one addiction at a time.
  - Redesign your environment for success.
  - Take daily identity-building actions, even if small (join a group, start a creative hobby, move your phone out of reach).
  - Measurement of progress: Not absence of urges, but the ability to pause and choose consciously.

- **Final Truth:**
  - You can’t quit as the person you are now. You have to *become* someone the addiction can’t “feed on” anymore. Identity transformation—not resistance—is the path to killing any addiction.[1]
