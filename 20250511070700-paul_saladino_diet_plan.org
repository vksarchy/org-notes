## Paul Saladino, MD–Inspired Animal-Based Diet Plan

Here’s a sample day based on Paul Saladino, MD’s animal-based approach, tailored for a healthy adult male. This plan prioritizes nutrient-dense animal foods, organs, fruit, honey, and raw dairy, while minimizing or excluding vegetables (except for low-toxicity options like squash or cucumber), grains, legumes, and processed foods.

---

### **Key Daily Targets**
- **Meat (Protein):** 1.5–1.8 lbs (680–820g) fatty red meat (e.g., ribeye, 80/20 ground beef) for 150–180g protein and 120–150g fat[1][3][6].
- **Organs:** 0.5 oz (15g) liver daily (or 2–3 oz/week), plus a few ounces of other organs (heart, kidney, pancreas, etc.)[1][3][6].
- **Carbs:** 150–225g from fruit and honey (adjust for activity level)[1][3][4].
- **Raw Dairy:** Up to 1L (about 4 cups) of raw milk and a few ounces of raw cheese or butter, as tolerated[1][3][6].
- **Calories:** 2,280–2,970 kcal, depending on your needs and activity[1][3].

---

## **Foods to Avoid or Minimize**
- Grains, legumes, and most vegetables (especially leaves, stems, roots, seeds)[5][6]
- Processed foods, seed oils, refined sugars, and artificial additives
- Pasteurized dairy (if sensitive or intolerant)

---

## **Supplements (Optional)**
- Desiccated organ supplements (if fresh organs are unavailable)[1][3]
- Creatine (for muscle and cognitive support)[1]

---

## **🧠 BRAIN MODE: Expert Guidance**

- This plan is highly satiating, nutrient-dense, and can support fat loss, muscle maintenance, and metabolic health.
- Adjust fruit/honey intake based on your energy needs and activity-more active individuals may benefit from the higher end of the carb range.
- If you tolerate eggs, include 2–4 pasture-raised eggs daily for variety.
- If raw dairy is not available or tolerated, substitute with high-quality aged cheese or omit.
- Rotate organ meats weekly for a broader micronutrient profile.
- Listen to your body and adjust portions or food choices for optimal digestion, energy, and enjoyment.

**This plan mirrors Paul Saladino’s animal-based diet: meat and organs for protein and micronutrients, fruit and honey for carbs, raw dairy for fats and additional nutrients, and a strong emphasis on food quality and variety.**[1][3][4][5][6]


* Summary
== Packed dense nutrition including organs, fruits, raw milk & honey, limited veggies and lots n lots of ground beef ==
## Who is Paul Saladino, MD, and What Does He Recommend?

**Paul Saladino, MD** is a double board-certified physician and a prominent advocate of the "animal-based diet." He is known for challenging mainstream nutritional advice and promoting a diet centered on animal foods, with a particular emphasis on nutrient density and the exclusion of processed foods[7][13][15].

---

## What is the Animal-Based Diet?

Paul Saladino’s animal-based diet is structured around the following core food groups:

- **Meat:** Emphasizes high-quality, fatty cuts (like ribeye, 80/20 ground beef), aiming for 1.5–1.8 lbs of meat daily to achieve 150–180g of protein[1][5][10].
- **Organs:** Recommends daily intake of about 0.5oz of liver (2–3oz per week) and a few ounces of other organs (heart, kidney, pancreas, etc.) for micronutrients[1][5][10].
- **Fruit & Honey:** Encourages 150–225g of carbohydrates from fruit and honey, believing these are optimal carb sources for humans, especially for those with moderate activity levels[1][5][10].
- **Raw Dairy:** Includes raw milk, cheese, and butter as tolerated, split across meals[1][5][10].
- **Supplements:** Sometimes recommends desiccated organ supplements if fresh organs are not available[5][10].

### Example Daily Intake (for moderate activity):

| Macronutrient | Range            |
|---------------|------------------|
| Protein       | 150–180g         |
| Fat           | 120–150g         |
| Carbs         | 150–225g (fruit, honey) |
| Calories      | 2,280–2,970 kcal |

## Key Principles and Rationale

- **Whole, Unprocessed Foods:** Saladino strongly advises eliminating ultra-processed foods, arguing these disrupt metabolism and contribute to chronic disease[7].
- **Animal Foods as Nutrient Dense:** He believes meat and organs provide the most bioavailable nutrients for humans.
- **Carbohydrates from Fruit & Honey:** Unlike strict carnivore diets, Saladino includes fruit and honey, citing improved energy, athletic performance, and digestion[7].
- **Plant Defense Chemicals:** He suggests that some people are sensitive to plant toxins and may benefit from minimizing or eliminating certain vegetables, especially if dealing with autoimmune or gut issues[7].
- **Intermittent Fasting:** Saladino has publicly changed his stance, no longer believing fasting or intermittent fasting is necessary for optimal health, and instead focuses on diet quality[9].

## 🧠 BRAIN MODE: Expert Insights

- Saladino’s approach is a blend of carnivore and paleo, with a unique emphasis on organs and raw dairy, and a rejection of most processed foods and grains.
- His diet is controversial in mainstream nutrition circles but has a dedicated following among those seeking alternatives to standard dietary guidelines.
- The inclusion of fruit and honey distinguishes his animal-based diet from strict carnivore regimens, aiming to balance performance and long-term sustainability.
