*When the Hunter got hunted 

Execution by one lady , the author tells it in the pov of himself depicting the incidents encountered by the lady and the beast. 

Chapter 1:
        *The Bait*
After strenious planning and coordinating with the necessary ppl , the plan was set in motion. 
Until the first action of the plan was taken, the whole thing was a fugazzi.
Ironically the plan was set in motion by him, the first step, the moment he stepped out of the country , she had no choice but to get in and takeover. 
Seeking the blessings of all, she and her daughter left immediately to Chennai. 
Her parents and mil were all ready. 
His mother was the one who always wanted to see this for a long time. 

Chapter 2: 
        *The Takeover*
After landing in Chennai and realising the day has come, she took a day off, coordinated with the rest of the team, waited for her mil and parents to pack their stuff up , as she knew she needed food and security not only for her but to that entire family,
      `It's not just me and my daughter encountering that beast, but my weak old parents and my mother-in-law all in their 80's, 
       Yes, I am worried and I fear for them `
Enter the lads: 
2 lads working out of great respect towards her and seeing the unjustice , voluntered to hunt the beast along with her.
She was the brains, these were the speed and muscle. 
She had to do it not for the financial , or for her daughter, or for the unjust happened to her , it was something deep, for herself , the feeling of redemption , the revenge. She was consumed by it and not out of hate. Hate was the last thing she had. REDEMPTION TIME. 

Chapter 3: 
        *D Day*
The next day, next phase of the plan was executed. 
She left for the takeover of the house. 
The house was empty and a house help was there. 
As she enterede the house,

She, her daughter, her parents and a helper moved the things she packed had packed for herself and some rations as she knew she cannot enter outside once she came in. 
The lads put in the work , the lock was brought, the security guy came in, the security cameras were switched off and replaced with new ones, the house keys and the transport keys were all taken up, she went up to seize her house documents and her belongings, shockingly found something. 
She found 2 guns and illegal documents of the companies that could potentially put him in jail.

Chapter 4: 
As they moved in to the other room , they saw and hit Jackpot!
