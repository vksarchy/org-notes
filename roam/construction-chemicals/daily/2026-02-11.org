# Concrete Roof Construction - Complete Process Guide

## Pre-Concreting Preparation

### 1. Formwork & Structural Verification
- **Formwork inspection**: Ensure shuttering is level, properly supported, and can withstand concrete load (minimum 3 days curing load)
- **Reinforcement check**: Verify rebar placement, spacing, cover blocks (25mm minimum for roofs), and proper tying
- **Surface preparation**: Clean formwork of debris, oil shuttering boards to prevent adhesion

### 2. Embedded Services Installation
**Electrical conduits & boxes:**
- Verify all conduit routes are installed as per electrical drawing
- Check junction boxes, switch points, fan boxes are securely tied to reinforcement
- Ensure conduit ends are capped to prevent concrete ingress
- Confirm adequate slack for future wiring

**Plumbing & drainage:**
- Install all required pipe sleeves and penetrations
- Check rainwater downpipe outlets positioning
- Verify terrace drainage slope provisions (minimum 1:100 gradient)
- Ensure all pipes are adequately supported and won't shift during concreting

### 3. Final Pre-Pour Inspection
- Measure and mark concrete level lines on columns (typically 125-150mm slab thickness)
- Check moisture in formwork (sprinkle water on dry surfaces)
- Arrange adequate labor, tools, and safety equipment
- Plan concreting sequence to avoid cold joints

## Concrete Mixing & Quality Control

### For Site-Mixed Concrete (Manual/Machine)

**M20 Grade Mix Ratio:**
- **Cement**: 1 part (typically 50kg bag)
- **M-Sand**: 1.5 parts (fine aggregate)
- **20mm Aggregates**: 3 parts (coarse aggregate)
- **Water**: 0.45-0.5 water-cement ratio (approximately 22-25 liters per 50kg cement)

**Mixing procedure:**
1. Measure materials by weight or volume using gauge boxes
2. Mix dry materials first (cement + sand + aggregates) for 1-2 minutes
3. Add water gradually while mixing
4. Mix for minimum 2 minutes until uniform color and consistency
5. Use within 30 minutes of mixing

**Quality checks:**
- Test concrete workability using slump test (target: 75-100mm for roof slabs)
- Check consistency batch-to-batch
- Avoid over-watering which reduces strength

### For Ready-Mix Concrete (RMC)

**Upon delivery verification:**
- Check delivery challan: grade (M20/M25), quantity, transit time (max 90 minutes)
- Note truck arrival time and mixing plant time
- Verify slump before starting pour

**Slump flow test:**
- Standard slump cone test: 75-100mm for M20 roof slabs
- Higher slump (100-125mm) acceptable if plasticizers used
- Reject if slump exceeds specifications or shows segregation

**Transit mixer discharge:**
- Maintain continuous pour, avoid delays
- Agitate drum between pours to prevent setting
- Never add water on-site without engineer approval

## Concrete Placement & Compaction

### Pouring Technique
1. **Start from corners/edges**: Work systematically towards exits
2. **Uniform layer thickness**: Pour 150-200mm depth layers, avoid dumping in heaps
3. **Avoid segregation**: Drop height maximum 1.5 meters
4. **Continuous pour**: Complete sections without breaks to prevent cold joints

### Compaction
- **Needle vibrator**: Insert vertically at 450mm spacing, 5-15 seconds per point
- Don't over-vibrate (causes segregation) or under-vibrate (creates voids)
- Vibrate into previous layer by 100mm to ensure bonding
- Avoid touching reinforcement directly with vibrator

### Level & Finish

**Screeding:**
- Use straight edge or screed board along level marks
- Fill low spots immediately
- Strike off excess concrete in smooth, sawing motion

**Surface finishing:**
- **Initial float**: Use wooden/magnesium float after bleeding water evaporates
- **Avoid broomstick/pipe rolling**: Use proper floats or trowels instead (broomstick creates uneven surface and weak spots)
- **Final finish**:
  - **For waterproofing base**: Use wooden float for slightly rough texture (better tile/waterproofing adhesion)
  - **For exposed finish**: Steel trowel for smooth finish
- **Terrace slope**: Maintain minimum 1:100 slope toward drainage outlets

**Thickness verification:**
- Check slab thickness periodically using measuring tape from formwork
- Standard roof slab: 125-150mm depending on span
- Mark and correct any deviations immediately

## Curing Process

### Immediate Protection (0-24 hours)
- Cover with wet gunny bags/plastic sheets within 2-3 hours of finishing
- Prevent direct sunlight and wind exposure
- No foot traffic for minimum 24 hours

### Active Curing (7-28 days)

**Water curing method (most effective):**
- **Days 1-3**: Spray water every 2-3 hours during daytime
- **Days 4-7**: Minimum 3-4 times daily
- **Days 8-14**: Twice daily (critical for strength development)
- **Days 15-28**: Once daily (for maximum strength)

**Alternative methods:**
- **Ponding**: Create 50mm water layer using sand bunds around perimeter (best for terraces)
- **Wet covering**: Keep gunny bags/hessian continuously saturated
- **Curing compounds**: Spray membrane-forming compounds (less effective than water)

**Important notes:**
- Never allow concrete to dry out during first 7 days
- 70% of design strength achieved in 7 days with proper curing
- Full 100% strength achieved in 28 days
- Inadequate curing = reduced strength, increased cracking, poor durability

### Formwork Removal
- **Slab soffit**: Minimum 14-21 days (varies by span and load)
- **Props/supports**: Leave at least 28 days for structural slabs
- Remove progressively, watching for deflection or cracking

## Quality Assurance

**Critical checkpoints:**
1. ✓ All embedments installed before pour
2. ✓ Correct concrete grade and mix ratio
3. ✓ Proper compaction without segregation
4. ✓ Uniform thickness throughout
5. ✓ Appropriate surface finish for intended use
6. ✓ Continuous moisture curing minimum 7 days

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Adding excess water for workability (reduces strength by 25-40%)
- Inadequate vibration (creates honeycombing)
- Starting cure too late (surface cracks)
- Removing formwork too early (structural failure risk)
- Interrupting curing cycle (weak concrete)

---

**Pro tip**: Take cube samples (minimum 3 nos.) during concreting for 7-day and 28-day compression testing to verify design strength achievement.
