#+title: How to speak brilliantly
#+date: [2025-08-08 Fri 00:27]
Here is a **detailed, comprehensive summary** of “How To Speak Brilliantly (Free Course)” by Joseph Tsar, covering all main ideas and tactics, with relevant examples:

1. Most People Never Solve High-Quality Communication Problems**
- 98% never learn to organize thoughts and turn them into powerful speech.
- The video aims to help you accomplish *epic* things and lead via speech.

2. Babblers vs. Elite Speakers**
- A “babbler” is unclear, swears a lot, lacks process for organizing thought.
- Society doesn’t train people for clear thought or speaking (unlike old societies that valued rhetoric and debate).

3. Three Qualities of Elite Speakers**
- **Clarity:** The most valuable “currency” in society—clear thinking leads to clear speaking.
  - *Example:* A Picasso sketch: Each version removes unnecessary detail, leaving only the “essence.”
- **Texture:** Ability to use vivid, striking word choices.
  - *Example:* “Baptized in perfume” vs. “wearing too much perfume.”
- **Comfort:** Feeling at ease with yourself and your presence—secure, no need to be loud.

4. Stages of Learning to Speak**
- Learn grammar as a child → public speaking training in college → realize words win or lose opportunities in interviews → deliver speeches (e.g., weddings) → learn from books → discover simple storytelling is king.

5. Clarity Comes from Clear Thinking**
- Clear speaking is a result of clear inputs/outputs.
  - *Inputs:* Music, books, people—these shape your thinking.
  - *Outputs:* Any creative expression—writing, voice memos, videos.
    - *Formula:* Clarity = Bad Output × Frequency → You get clearer by expressing ideas repeatedly, improving after each attempt.

6. System for Developing Clarity**
- Identify 10 topics you need clarity on—discuss/explain each, one per day, for 10 days.
- Repeat for another 10 days, film 3-minute daily videos.
- *Example:* Clients upload private videos to a channel for review.

7. Why Writing Isn’t Enough**
- Writing overdevelops your “inner editor.” Speaking is more about flow and spontaneity.
- Suggests recording your speech, not just writing.

8. Texture—The Art of Word Choice**
- **Surface lexicon:** ~1,500 words used automatically.
- **Deep lexicon:** 25,000–35,000 words; require conscious thought until repetition makes them automatic.
  - *Example:* Repeating a word 200 times makes it part of your surface lexicon.
- Input shapes patterns—your personality reflects in your word choice.

9. Three Steps to Build Texture**
- Find articulate language.
- Collect examples of articulate language.
- Practice with them.
  - *Example:* Greeks documented 250+ rhetorical devices to move people.

10. Two Ways to Add Texture**
- **Sharpen Speech:** Fill in the details.
  - *Example:* “I was nervous going to talk” → “I wiped my sweaty palms on my jeans walking over.”
- **Add Color (Surprise):** Use unexpected or fresh phrases.
  - *Example:* “My motivation evaporated” instead of “I burned out at work.”

11. Use Personal Experience for Texture**
- Ask: “When have I experienced this?” Describe that experience in detail:
  - **TAKES Method:** Time, Audio, Kesthetics (touch/feel), Eyes (sight), Smell
  - *Example:* “While running: wind through hair, smell of fresh-cut grass, feet slapping pavement”

12. Charisma = Lived Experience**
- Charisma is the sum of what you’ve endured; wisdom is earned.
- *Example:* Hermits/monks/wizards sound so clear because they’ve experienced and reflected deeply.

13. Practicing Surprise with a “Vocal Ego”**
- Create a representation of your elite/future self (“Vocal Ego”) to review your speech and offer phrasing upgrades.
- *Example:* Use a custom ChatGPT model to analyze your transcripts, then practice the new suggestions.

14. Compare Poor to Good Speech**
- Speak poorly, compare with elite phrasing, and repeat better speech (deliberate practice).
  - *Example:* Within days, such practice leads to major improvement.

15. Comfort—The Foundation for Speaking Well**
- Comfort is more important than charisma (which people often chase without knowing).
- Discomfort usually rooted in:
  - Uncalm body
  - Unclear mission
  - Mismatch between words and beliefs

16. Body, Mind, Spirit Preparation**
- **Body:** Use deep (diaphragm) breathing to steady your voice; example—**Box Breathing** (inhale, hold, exhale, hold for four seconds each, repeat four times).
- **Mind:** Have a clear mission—remind yourself “I am here to give the gift of my presence.”
- **Spirit:** Speak from values. Know your core values as “scaffolding” for your speech.
  - *Example values:* Gratitude, compassion, humility, respect, simplicity.
  - If values are misaligned, speech feels artificial.

17. How to Build and Strengthen Values**
- Pick a value, act on it, reinforce each time you speak.
  - *Example:* If you value honesty, admit what you don't know.

18. Bonus: Food and Sleep for Better Speaking**
- Both directly impact clarity and speech.
- Track your food/sleep for two weeks; have AI find optimal patterns.
  - *Example found by Joseph:*
    - Clarity best when avoiding carbs before 2pm.
    - Sleep “golden zone” = 6–7 hours; too little/too much = brain fog.

Summary Example Pointers:**
- “Sharpen your speech by describing a moment with all your senses.”
- “If you struggle to find the right word, collect examples and practice them.”
- “Your breathing, values, sleep, and even what you eat all matter—optimize these to speak at your best.”
